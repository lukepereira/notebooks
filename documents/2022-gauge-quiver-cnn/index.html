<div class="abstract-title">Abstract</div>
<p>This paper aims to extend Graph Convolution Networks (GCN) using
findings from algebraic geometry and gauge theory involving Dynkin
quivers and Gabriel’s theorem on ADE classification. We propose the
construction of a “universal" graph kernel formalized as an ADE gauge
quiver, to be used for generic classification tasks with architecture
and training methods inspired by diffusion on Sheaf Neural Networks
(SNN). After validating this framework with experiments, we flesh out
theory motivating these design choices, namely an error or residue
estimation formulated in terms of a symplectic monodromy group.</p>

data-cites="10.1007/BFb0081739">[@10.1007/BFb0081739]</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To begin, we claim an equivalence between Sheaf Neural Networks (<a
href="#sec:sheaf-nn" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:sheaf-nn">2.5</a>) and representations of quivers
(<a href="#sec:quiver-representations" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:quiver-representations">2.1</a>) by relaxing
constraints on a sheaf connection Laplacian to no longer be strictly
positive semi-definite. By allowing the connection Laplacian to have an
indefinite form with positive, zero, or negative eigenvalues, we prevent
the “gluing" axiom of sheaves from holding and instead have a presheaf,
which can more readily be equated to a quiver representation (<a
href="#sec:sheaf-quiver-equiv" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:sheaf-quiver-equiv">2.7</a>). In the context of
classification tasks, the gluing axiom of sheaves is necessary to allow
for simple diffusion by forming restriction maps between all pairwise
node combinations (<a href="#sec:sheaf-diffusion"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:sheaf-diffusion">2.6</a>).
However, when an indefinite connection Laplacian and disconnected
presheaf takes on values from an algebraically closed field, we may
instead derive an equality with quiver representations (<a
href="#sec:sheaf-quiver-equiv" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:sheaf-quiver-equiv">2.7</a>). Then, by invoking
Gabriel’s Theorem, we find that <em>all</em> finite quiver
representations (equivalently, all presheaf connection Laplacians) must
have underlying connected subgraphs that can be classified with ADE
types (<a href="#sec:dynkin-diagrams" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:dynkin-diagrams">2.2</a>). Thus, Gabriel’s Theorem
enables restoring a weaker gluing axiom and a modified diffusion
mechanism by using tree subgraphs and the nodal surplus of cycles. In
this alternative setting, the connection Laplacian becomes more akin to
a graph convolution kernel (<a href="#sec:graph-kernel"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:graph-kernel">2.9</a>).
The proposed ADE subgraphs are bipartite trees and were originally
developed to describe relationships between irreducible representations
(irreps) and root systems of simply connected Lie groups: SL(N+1),
SU(2N), E6, E7, E8. Using spectral analysis, namely Perron-Frobenius
theorem, we may classify subtrees into their ADE type using their unique
bounded spectral radius <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_r \leq
2\)</span> (<a href="#sec:spectral-corr" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:spectral-corr">2.12</a>).</p>
<p>To formulate an alternative to sheaf diffusion, we need information
about the non-trivial topology that results from a graphs cycles not
captured by its ADE subtrees. A relevant stream of research also applies
spectral methods through magnetic field perturbations to a graph
Laplacian in order to compute its nodal surplus, which directly relates
to a graphs cyclic structure (<a href="#sec:magnetic-laplacian"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:magnetic-laplacian">2.10</a>). Transitioning from an
arbitrary graph to a collection of trees requires breaking <span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> cycles, where <span
class="math inline">\(\beta = |E| - |V| + 1\)</span> is the graph’s
first Betti number, which will be considered as the rank 1
perturbations. It is known that the <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-th eigenfunction of a Laplacian has
<span class="math inline">\((n - 1 + s)\)</span> “zeroes", where a zero
corresponds to graph edges where the eigenfunction changes sign and
<span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is the nodal surplus or defect,
which is an integer between <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and
the number of cycles. The examined method induces perturbations on a
Laplacian using a magnetic field (i.e. a discretized Schrodinger
operator) parameterized by its eigenvalues in what’s known as a magnetic
Laplacian. The fundamental result proves that the Morse index of the
critical points of the perturbation field are equal to the nodal surplus
of the original graph. The process of diffusion on the connection
Laplacian and the application of Morse theory on critical points of the
magnetic Laplacian have close similarities when studying the Hessian of
each Laplacian as a mediator of covariance (<a href="#sec:hessian-corr"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:hessian-corr">2.11</a>).</p>
<p>Relating the two findings we aim to develop a graph kernel that
captures a rich and invariant representation of both the graphs subtrees
and its cycles. We propose a kernel that can be thought of as a
histogram of the simply-connected Lie groups corresponding to ADE trees
along with a symplectic monodromy group that captures the nodal surplus
and their relations to the magnetic Laplacian zeroes. A monodromy group
is the quotient of holonomy group (roughly, its nontrivial cycles) by
the normal subgroup formed by parallel transports along homotopically
trivial loops (roughly, its ADE trees). This graph kernel made of ADE
trees and a symplectic monodromy group can be succinctly described as a
gauge quiver or quiver diagram (<a href="#sec:gauge-quiver"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:gauge-quiver">2.4</a>).
Training data produces a monodromy group of divergences from energy
minimizing geodesics between irreps on the quiver. Recall that relaxing
the strictly non-zero constraint on eigenvalues of the connection
Laplacian leads us to Gabriel’s theorem of ADE tree classification,
while relaxing the constraint on linearity of an eigenvector by
considering non-linear perturbations of an eigenfunction leads to
topological information about a graph’s nodal surplus and cyclic
structure. We may examine the nonlinearity and indefiniteness of the
spectra in both settings by considering a device known as a Gromov width
or <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-width (<a
href="#sec:gromov-width" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:gromov-width">2.13</a>). This width is proposed to
be interpreted as <em>nonlinear spectra</em> of a Laplacian and can be
used to bound volume spectrum in an isoperimetric law. In a learning
mechanism, this is used to limit the number of ADE trial graphs in a
random-walk type graph kernel. This is presented in more detail in the
following section.</p>

<h2 id="sec:quiver-representations">Quiver Representations</h2>
<p>Although it is straightforward to say that quivers are identical to
directed graphs, their usefulness arises from a change in perspective
that allows formulating connections between simplicial graphs and
continuous topology through representation theory and categorical set
theory. We may motivate this less intuitive viewpoint by recalling
Grothendieck’s notion of <em>relative point of view</em>, where instead
of holding up individual objects, one works with families of objects or
categories that depend on a creatively constructed parameterization.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong>Definition 1</strong>. Formally, a quiver is given by <span
class="math inline">\(Q=(Q_0, Q_1, s, t)\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(Q_0,Q_1\)</span> are finite sets with <span
class="math inline">\(Q_0\)</span> being vertices, <span
class="math inline">\(Q_1\)</span> being arrows corresponding to edges,
and <span class="math inline">\(s, t: Q_1 \to Q_0\)</span> being maps
referred to as the source and target sets of a given edge. An arrow
<span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in Q_1\)</span> is written as <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha: s(\alpha) \to t(\alpha)\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>With this change in perspective, we allow vertices <span
class="math inline">\(Q_0\)</span> to become fundamental while edges
<span class="math inline">\(Q_1\)</span> become closer to categorical
sets. The quiver <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> can be perceived
as something more akin to a point cloud than a graph; though instead of
the points being embedded in a topological space like <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^3\)</span>, they are embedded in an
algebraic field. Edges being referred to as arrows suggests a
categorical parameterization, so that they relate sets (or equivalence
classes) of what were formerly scalar values. An underlying graph <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{Q}\)</span> can be recovered by indexing into
subset of the output of adjacent pairs of surjective mappings <span
class="math inline">\(s, t\)</span> applied to an arrow <span
class="math inline">\(\{s(\alpha), t(\alpha)\}\)</span>.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong>Definition 2</strong>. A quiver representation <span
class="math inline">\(M=(M_x, M_\alpha)\)</span> is given by vector
spaces <span class="math inline">\(M_x\)</span> for vertex <span
class="math inline">\(x \in Q_0\)</span> and linear maps <span
class="math inline">\(M_\alpha: M_{s(\alpha)} \to
M_{t(\alpha)}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>A representation of a quiver Q is an association of an R-module to
each vertex of Q and a morphism between each module for each arrow.
Continuing the previous analogy, a quiver thought of as an algebraic
point cloud now also takes on a topological embedding (similar to real
point clouds) using its linear or fibered representations. A
representation is said to be decomposable if it is isomorphic to the
direct sum of non-zero representations. This notion is closely related
to irreducibility of group generators and root systems,</p>
<p>In categorical terms, we can define a quiver to be a functor <span
class="math inline">\(G:X^{\normalfont{op}}\to \mathsf{Set}\)</span>,
where <span class="math inline">\(X^{op}\)</span> is the category with
objects <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and two morphisms <span
class="math inline">\(s,t:1 \to 0\)</span>, along with identity
morphisms. This lets us define <span
class="math inline">\(\mathsf{Quiv}\)</span> as the category of
presheaves on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, where objects are
functors and morphisms are natural transformations between such
functors. Then a representation of <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> is a covariant functor from this
category to the category of finite dimensional vector spaces. Morphisms
between representations commute with arrows allowing for representations
to also be considered an Abelian category.</p>
<h2 id="sec:dynkin-diagrams">Dynkin Diagrams</h2>
<p>The initial ambitions of representation theory were to construct
lists of all the indecomposable representations when possible, and only
after to consider homomorphisms and extensions between the
indecomposable objects. It turns out that the list of indecomposables is
typically quite uninteresting, and instead, describing the internal
categorical structure and the interplay between indecomposable
representations would yield much deeper insights. In order to do so, one
may look at sets of indecomposables which are related either by small
changes of parameters or by the existence of irreducible maps. The
interplay and binding of particular irreducible representations can be
understood as an algebra or even a dynamical system in a differential
setting as with Lie Groups. Then, the periodic cycles, orbits, or
automorphisms are the algebraic structures that bind irreducible
representations to a group structure.</p>
<p>Dynkin diagrams first appeared in relation to the classification of
simple Lie groups where they describe a basis of roots for a path
algebra that spans a complex semi-simple Lie algebra or a compact Lie
algebra and its corresponding simply laced Lie groups. P. Gabriel
introduced the notion of a quiver and its representations and used them
to prove the famous Gabriel’s theorem on representations of quivers over
algebraically closed field.</p>
<div class="theorem">
<p><strong>Theorem 1</strong>. <em>Let <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> be a finite quiver and <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{Q}\)</span> the undirected graph obtained
from <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> by deleting the orientation
of all arrows. A connected quiver <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>
is of finite type if and only if the graph <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{Q}\)</span> is one of the following simply
laced Dynkin diagrams: <span class="math inline">\(A_n, D_n, E_6,
E_7\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(E_8\)</span>.</em></p>
</div>
<h2 id="sec:ade">ADE Classification</h2>
<p>Dynkin diagrams have the following correspondence with the Lie
algebras associated to classical groups over the complex numbers. ADE
types have additional compact Lie algebras and corresponding simply
laced Lie groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(A_{n}\)</span>: <span
class="math inline">\({\mathfrak{sl}}_{{n+1}}(\mathbb{C})\)</span>, the
special linear Lie algebra of traceless operators. Also corresponds to
<span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{su}_{n+1}(\mathbb{R})\)</span>,
the algebra of the special unitary group <span
class="math inline">\(SU(n+1)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(B_{n}\)</span>: <span
class="math inline">\({\mathfrak {so}}_{{2n+1}}(\mathbb{C})\)</span>,
the odd-dimensional special orthogonal Lie algebra.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(C_{n}\)</span>: <span
class="math inline">\({\mathfrak {sp}}_{{2n}}(\mathbb{C})\)</span>, the
symplectic Lie algebra.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(D_{n}\)</span>: <span
class="math inline">\({\mathfrak {so}}_{{2n}}(\mathbb{C})\)</span>, the
even-dimensional special orthogonal Lie algebra (<span
class="math inline">\(n&gt;1\)</span>) of even-dimensional
skew-symmetric operators. Also corresponds to <span
class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{so}_{2n}(\mathbb{R})\)</span>, the
algebra of the even projective special orthogonal group <span
class="math inline">\(PSO(2n)\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(E_6, E_7, E_8\)</span>: the names for
the exceptional Lie groups and algebras coincide with the associated
Dynkin diagram.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The graphs describes a finite reflection group with each node
representing a reflection satisfying relations depicted as (labeled)
edges. The edges in the graphs show that two fundamental roots are not
orthogonal (perpendicular) but differ by 120 degrees or <span
class="math inline">\(2\pi/3\)</span>. We can consider repeated
reflective action as an exponential rotation of <span
class="math inline">\((2 \pi /3)^k\)</span> that yields equivalences
between self or pairs. These self or pairwise interactions with
exponents of 2 have no edge. Interactions with exponents of 3 have
labels omitted. Repeated reflections resulting in the identity (periodic
automorphisms) are shown to be equivalent to commutativity between pairs
of generators (See <a href="#sec:automorphisms"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:automorphisms">3.2</a>).</p>
<p>We can think of the diagrams as a topological group being condensed
or encoded into a graph depicting interactions of its generators, which
are its irreducible representations or roots. Dynkin diagrams summarize
relative orientations and orderings of these roots through a
kaleidoscopic construction that describe its topology in terms of the
graphs path algebra. Omitting certain edges produces a diagram
corresponding to an orthogonal summation of a groups irreducible root
systems.</p>

<h2 id="sec:sheaf-nn">Sheaf Neural Networks</h2>
<p>A Sheaf Neural Network is a type of Graph Neural Network that
operates on a sheaf, an object that equips a graph with vector spaces
over its nodes and edges and linear maps between these spaces.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong>Definition 4</strong>. A cellular sheaf <span
class="math inline">\((G, \mathcal{F})\)</span> on an undirected graph
<span class="math inline">\(G = (V, E)\)</span> consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A vector space <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}(v)\)</span> for each <span
class="math inline">\(v \in V\)</span>,</p></li>
<li><p>A vector space <span

class="math inline">\(e \in E\)</span>,</p></li>
<li><p>A linear map <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}_{v \unlhd e}
: \mathcal{F}(v) \to \mathcal{F}(e)\)</span> for each incident node-edge
pair <span class="math inline">\(v \unlhd e\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>This definition closely resembles that of the quiver representation,
though there is an additional vector space equipped to each edge and
linear maps explicitly given between each pair of nodes. This allows the
presheaf corresponding to the quiver representation to be promoted into
a sheaf by satisfying an additional "gluing" axiom.</p>
<p>The vector spaces of the node and edges are called stalks, while the
linear maps are called restriction maps. It is possible to group the
various spaces by interpreting the graph as a 1-dimensional simplicial
complex. In this setting, the 0-dimensional simplicies correspond to
nodes and the 1-dimensional simplicies are edges. A <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-chain of a simplicial complex is the
sum of its <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> dimensional
simplicies. For a graph, the 0-chains are aggregation of nodes and
1-chains are aggregations of edges. Likewise, the dual space formed by
the node stalks is called the space of 0-cochains, while the dual space
formed by edge stalks is called the space of 1-cochains.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong>Definition 5</strong>. Given a sheaf <span
class="math inline">\((G, \mathcal{F})\)</span>, we define the space of
<span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>-cochains <span
class="math inline">\(C^0(G, F)\)</span> as the direct sum over the
vertex stalks <span class="math inline">\(C^0 (G, F) := \oplus_{v\in V}
\mathcal{F}(v)\)</span>. Similarly, the space of 1-cochains <span
class="math inline">\(C^1(G, F)\)</span> as the direct sum over the edge
stalks <span class="math inline">\(C^1(G, F) := \oplus_{e\in E}
\mathcal{F}(e)\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong>Definition 6</strong>. Given some arbitrary orientation for
each edge <span class="math inline">\(e = u \to v, e \in E\)</span>, we
define the coboundary map <span class="math inline">\(\delta : C^0 (G,
F) \to C^1(G, F)\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\delta(x)_e =
\mathcal{F}_{v \unlhd e} x_v - \mathcal{F}_{u \unlhd e} x_u\)</span>.
Here <span class="math inline">\(x \in C^0(G, F)\)</span> is a 0-cochain
and <span class="math inline">\(x_v \in \mathcal{F}(v)\)</span> is the
vector of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> at the node stalk <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}(v)\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>A <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-boundary is considered to be
the aggregation of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-simplicies in
a <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-chain that takes <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-chains to <span
class="math inline">\(p+1\)</span>-chains. A <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-coboundary is a dual homomorphism that
that takes <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-cochains to <span
class="math inline">\(p+1\)</span>-cochains. From an opinion dynamics
perspective (Hansen &amp; Ghrist, 2021), the node stalks may be thought
of as the private space of opinions and the edge stalks as the space in
which these opinions are shared in a public discourse space. The
coboundary map <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> then measures
the disagreement between all the nodes.</p>
<p>A <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-cycle describes a loop
resulting from a closed <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-chain. A
homology group is defined by quotienting the group of <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-cycles <span
class="math inline">\(Z_p\)</span> by the group of <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-boundaries <span
class="math inline">\(B_p\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(H_p
= Z_p / B_p\)</span>. Similarly the cohomology group can be defined as a
quotient of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-cocycles and <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-coboundaries, i.e. <span
class="math inline">\(H^p = Z^p / B^p\)</span>. This will be relevant in
later sections involving symplectic cyclic geometry. Recall the previous
notion of Dynkin quiver representations having <span
class="math inline">\(Ext^2=0\)</span>, this would be equivalent to
having empty cohomology, meaning the group of coboundaries would be
infinite or the group of cycles is empty. Conversely, we may use this
restriction to categorize the manner in which the data diverges from
being acyclic or a tree quiver.</p>
<p>The sheaf Laplacian operator is a symmetric positive semi-definite
block matrix resulting from multiplication of the the co-boundary
operator by its transpose. By making the sheaf laplacian symmetric, we
force the “gluing” axiom to be true, and enable the pre-sheaf to become
a sheaf. This also means the sheaf has a similar undirected nature as
the underlying graph and makes spectral analysis possible.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong>Definition 7</strong>. The sheaf Laplacian of a sheaf is a
map <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}_\mathcal{F} : C^0(G,
\mathcal{F}) \to C^0(G, \mathcal{F})\)</span> defined as <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}_\mathcal{F} = \delta^T
\delta\)</span>. The normalised sheaf Laplacian <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta \mathcal{F}\)</span> is defined as <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta \mathcal{F} = D^{-\frac{1}{2}}
\mathcal{L}_\mathcal{F} D^{-\frac{1}{2}}\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is the blockdiagonal of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}_{F}\)</span> .</p>
</div>
<p>If we constrain the restriction maps in the sheaf to belong to the
orthogonal group, the sheaf becomes a discrete <span
class="math inline">\(O(d)\)</span>-bundle and can be thought of as a
discretised version of a tangent bundle on a manifold. The sheaf
Laplacian of the <span class="math inline">\(O(d)\)</span>-bundle is
equivalent to a connection Laplacian used by Singer &amp; Wu (2012). The
orthogonal restriction maps describe how vectors are rotated when
transported between stalks, in a way analogous to the transportation of
tangent vectors on a manifold.</p>
<h2 id="sec:sheaf-diffusion">Neural Sheaf Diffusion</h2>
<p>Consider a graph <span class="math inline">\(G = (V, E)\)</span>
where each node <span class="math inline">\(v \in V\)</span> has a <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span>-dimensional feature vector <span
class="math inline">\(x_v \in \mathcal{F}(v)\)</span>. We construct an
<span class="math inline">\(nd\)</span>-dimensional vector <span
class="math inline">\(x \in C^0 (G, F)\)</span> by column-stacking the
individual vectors <span class="math inline">\(x_v\)</span>. Allowing
for <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> feature channels, we produce
the feature matrix <span class="math inline">\(X \in \mathbb{R}^{(nd)
\times f}\)</span>. The columns of <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> are vectors in <span
class="math inline">\(C^0 (G, F)\)</span>, one for each of the <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> channels. Sheaf diffusion is a process
on <span class="math inline">\((G, F)\)</span> governed by the following
discreted diffusion equation: <span class="math display">\[X_{t+1} = X_t
- \sigma(\Delta_{\mathcal{F}(t)} I_n \otimes W^t_1 ) X_t
W^t_2\]</span></p>
<p>It is important to note that the sheaf <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}(t)\)</span> and the weights <span
class="math inline">\(W^t_1, W^t_2\)</span> are time-dependent, meaning
that the underlying “geometry” evolves over time. The diffusion of
features into the kernel of the laplacian can be understood as
convolution of adjacent nodes in which the sheaf serves as a
multi-headed attention mechanism.</p>
<h2 id="sec:sheaf-quiver-equiv">Equivalence of presheaves and quiver
representations</h2>
<p>By relaxing constraints on the sheaf Laplacian being symmetric
positive semi-definite and omitting constraints on the restriction maps,
we can construct an equivalence between a pre-sheaf and a finite quiver
representation. To maintain the symmetry of the presheaf Laplacian we
need only to require that that its associated underlying Dynkin graph be
strongly connected and undirected.</p>
<h2 id="sec:sheafification">Sheafification</h2>
<p>We may observe that the sheaves on <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> form a full subcategory of the
presheaves on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. Implicitly the
morphisms of sheaves are nothing more than natural transformations of
the sheaves considered as functors. Therefore, we get an abstract
characterisation of sheafification as left adjoint to the inclusion.</p>
<p>There are two ways a presheaf can fail to be a sheaf.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It has local sections that should patch together to give a global
section, but don’t,</p></li>
<li><p>It has non-zero sections which are locally zero.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the classical case of sheaves on a topological space,
sheafification of the Yoneda embedding preserves colimits by open
covers. In the general case of categories, one replaces open covers with
covering sieves to develop a Grothendieck Topology.</p>
<h2 id="sec:graph-kernel">Graph convolution kernel</h2>
<p>Random walk kernel is a direct product of a pair of graphs used to

rounds of WL algorithm computes similarity as inner product of histogram
vectors. Kernel collects number of times color occurs in graph on

cartesian product instead of kronecker product allows for decomposition.
Paths are a special kind of subgraphs that work using kronecker
optimization tricks. Cycles or trees, i.e. anything between arbitrary

<h2 id="sec:sieve">Sieves and the Riemann Hypotheses</h2>
<p>The sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm for finding all
prime numbers up to any given limit and provides a useful blueprint for
other ideas. It works by iteratively marking as composite (i.e., not
prime) the multiples of each prime, starting with the first prime
number, <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. Once all the multiples
of each discovered prime have been marked as composites, the remaining
unmarked numbers are primes. The optimal implementation iterates up to
the square of the given limit, i.e. <span
class="math inline">\(n^{\frac{1}{2}}\)</span>. It does so because a
prime element in a composite number could not be larger than the square
of the limit. This <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> is
comparable to the square-root error term of the prime number counting
function which is equivalent to the <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> critical strip in the Riemann
Hypotheses.</p>
<p>The Hilbert–Pólya conjecture suggests that one way to derive the
Riemann hypothesis would be to find a self-adjoint operator, from the
existence of which the statement on the real parts of the zeros of <span
class="math inline">\(\zeta (s)\)</span> would follow when one applies
the criterion on real eigenvalues. Some support for this idea comes from
several analogues of the Riemann zeta functions whose zeros correspond
to eigenvalues of some operator: the zeros of a zeta function of a
variety over a finite field correspond to eigenvalues of a Frobenius
element on an étale cohomology group, the zeros of a Selberg zeta
function are eigenvalues of a Laplacian operator of a Riemann surface,
and the zeros of a p-adic zeta function correspond to eigenvectors of a
Galois action on ideal class groups.</p>
<p>In algebraic geometry, the spectrum <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> of a commutative ring <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is the space of prime ideals of <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> with a natural topology (known as the
Zariski topology). Grothendieck proposed augmenting it with a sheaf of
rings: to every open subset <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> he
assigned a commutative ring <span class="math inline">\(O_X(U)\)</span>.
These objects <span class="math inline">\({\displaystyle \operatorname
{Spec} {R}}\)</span> are the affine schemes; a general scheme is then
obtained by "gluing together" affine schemes. In the classical case of
sheaves on a topology, the gluing axiom required for sheafification is
phrased in terms of pointwise coverings. In the general case of
categories, Grothendieck topologies replace each open subset with an
entire family of open subsets, known as covering sieves. This allows
binding common elements between stalks in order to develop a topology to
associate with a potentially discontinous category producing sites.
Grothendieck topologies were used to implement étale or Weil
cohomologies which were used for proving parts of the Weil conjectures.
The Weil conjectures include an analog to Riemann Hypotheses but are
instead concerning varieties over a finite field.</p>
<p>In representation theory, a spectrum of a matrix is its eigenvalues.
Spectral bounds can be used to classify Dynkin graphs into their
isomorphism classes (<a href="#sec:spectral-corr"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:spectral-corr">2.12</a>).
Moreover, Dynkin graphs encode the internal categorical structure and
the interplay between groups of irreps generating a simply connected Lie
group. Perhaps the ADE gauge quiver to be used as a kernel can be
constructed through a sieve-like process that identifies irreps that
bind and relate Dynkin graphs together into a gauge quiver, much in the
same way as sheafification of categories occurs through sieve coverings
and in topologies with the left adjoint. This gauge quiver may relate to
what Alain Connes describes as the “mysterious structure underlying the
compactification of <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Spec}
\mathbb{Z}\)</span>” in his essay on the Riemann Hypothesis in which he
also preesents a solution strategy involving the development of a
suitable Weil cohomology. The category of motives is defined to be a
category such that every Weil cohomology (viewed as a functor) factors
through it. Motivic cohomology are iterated extensions between two
motives. Could there be a motivic cohomology (similar to an étale
cohomology of a Grothendieck topology), that derives binding irreps
between Lie groups through iterated extensions of their motives?</p>
<p>As mentioned, the zeros of a Zeta function of a variety over a finite
field correspond to eigenvalues of a Frobenius element on an étale
cohomology group. Here, the Frobenius endomorphism can be understood as
an analog of the exponential, as it maps every element to its <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-th power. In Riemannian geometry, the
exponential map is a map from a subset of a tangent space <span
class="math inline">\(TpM\)</span> of a Riemannian manifold <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> itself. The “<span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-sweepout recipe” can be used for
computing curvature at point <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> by
using its exponential map to produce geodesics in the range <span
class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span> that sweepout a tangent submanifold
which can then have its Gaussian curvature computed using the Theorema
Egregium on symmetric properties of the Riemannian metric. <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> marks the region of flat
Gaussian curvature and is the center of the exponential map between
<span class="math inline">\([0, 1]\)</span>. In Lie theory, the
exponential map is a map from the Lie algebra <span
class="math inline">\({\mathfrak {g}}\)</span> of a Lie group <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> to the group, which allows one to
recapture the local group structure from the Lie algebra. The existence
of the exponential map is one of the primary reasons that Lie algebras
are a useful tool for studying Lie groups in representation theory.
(When a Lie group is not simply connected, representations of its Lie
group and its Lie algebra are not in one-to-one correspondence, this
results in distinctions between integer spin and half-integer spin in
quantum mechanics producing fermions and bosons. For example, the
rotation group <span class="math inline">\(SO(3)\)</span> is not simply
connected There is one irreducible representation of the Lie algebra in
each dimension, but only the odd-dimensional representations of the Lie
algebra come from representations of the group. There is more that can
be said regarding Yang-Mills gauge theory, Donaldson Theory, and flat
instanton connections and singularities.)</p>
<p>From this perspective, perhaps the critical strip of the RH has some
correlation to an optimal bound of an isoperimetric law. Moreover,
perhaps it can be described by the ubiquitous Dynkin Diagrams. One can
imagine how the construction of Gromov p-widths, visualized as touching
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-spheres spanning a <span
class="math inline">\(k+1\)</span> dimensional width to produce a
volumetric bound, can be described with Dynkin Diagrams. Much like how
the blow up of an ADE or duVal singularity is described as a union of
Riemann spheres that touch each other to form the shape of the Dynkin
diagram. Then, perhaps the <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> of the exponential map
relates to polar points of the sweepout of the projective complex
Riemann sphere.</p>
<h2 id="sec:automorphisms">Automorphisms of Dynkin Diagrams</h2>
<p>Conjugation invariance (like the reflection periodicity) is also
equivalent to commutation. The normal subgroup, which is an equivalance
class of the identity, is the center of an orbit and can also be
understood as a measure of commutativity. Inner automorphisms measure
failure/divergence from commutativity, outer automorphisms measure the
non-inner automorphisms and are isomorphic to automorphisms of Dynkin
diagrams. As seen in Gabriel’s theorem, any finite representation must
have underlying ADE graphs. Automorphisms of ADE diagrams are equivalent
to the outer Automorphism group which composes with the inner
automorphism group that represents a measure of noncommutativity
(non-abelian) of the group. Dynkin quivers can’t have any indecomposable
quiver representations nor have automorphisms other than scalars, nor
any self-extensions. Neural sheafs may be more akin to derived category
of coherent sheaves (on a smooth algebraic or projective variety and and
on their noncommutative counterparts). Recall, the cohomology group can
be defined as a quotient of <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-cocycles and <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-coboundaries, i.e. <span
class="math inline">\(H^p = Z^p / B^p\)</span>. As seen in sheaf neural
networks, this can be related to the sheaf Laplacian constructed from
coboundaries of cellular or simplicial complexes.</p>
