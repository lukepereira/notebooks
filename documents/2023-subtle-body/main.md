  It is proposed that the *grounding* of concepts into an embodied
  intelligence is developed from synesthetic multi-modal sense samples
  of our perception. Moreover, it is argued that our synesthetic sense
  perceptions forms the basis of what is referred to as the "subtle
  body" described in Buddhist writings. The refinement of the subtle
  body is fundamental to Buddhist ethics and moral phenomenology, which
  is in contrast Aristotelian virtue ethics, Kantian deontology or
  rule-based ethics, as well as British utilitarian consequentialism. A
  formalization of the subtle body allows us to explore its application
  to ethics alignment of artificial intelligent agents. A synesthetic
  model of the subtle body allows for its geometrization through
  representation theory, which naturally integrates into pre-training
  inductive biases into representation learning models. The synesthetic
  experience of interest is the shared activations related to different
  sensory stimuli. Since the encoding of senses varies from differences
  in biological pathways and data modalities, synesthesia can be
  generally described as invariants of morphisms between activated sense
  data of different sensory stimuli. In particular, certain objects
  stimulate multiple sense doors and trigger a simultaneous experience
  of smell, taste, or touch. Through synesthetic sensory interactions
  with various objects and environments, agents develop a collection of
  invariant representations that spans all sense modalities and
  phenomenal range. This forms a category that can be de-contextualized
  from the particular objects originally observed into its own entity of
  perception. We can formalize this object through category theory as a
  Skeleton category and more specifically through representation theory
  as a quiver gauge theory. This category of synesthetic invariants has
  phenomenology comparable to the subtle body. The subtle (or energy)
  body is a non-physical object of meditation that is manipulated during
  various practices, often producing altered states and generating
  insights. The disruption and transformation of a spanning body schema
  is also comparable to the disruption of GCPRs (mediating various sense
  perceptions) by psychedelics, which also appears to disrupt predictive
  coding hierarchies leading to altered states.
