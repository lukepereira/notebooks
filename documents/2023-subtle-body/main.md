  It is proposed that the *grounding* of concepts into an embodied
  intelligence is initially developed from synesthetic multi-modal sense
  samples of perception. Moreover, it is argued that collections of
  synesthetic sense perception forms the basis or skeleton of what is
  referred to as the "subtle body" in the Buddhist Pali canon. The
  subtle (or energy) body is a non-physical object of meditation derived
  from awareness of subtle sense and musculature observations that is
  refined and manipulated during various meditation and yoga practices,
  often producing altered states and generating insights. The refinement
  of awareness and control of the subtle body is fundamental to the
  development of wisdom and moral phenomenology in Buddhist ethics,
  which contrasts Aristotelian virtue ethics, Kantian rule-based ethics
  (deontology), and British utilitarian consequentialism. A formal
  description of the subtle body allows us to explore its application to
  the ethics and alignment of artificial intelligent agents. A
  synesthetic model of the subtle body enables its geometrization
  through representation theory, which can naturally be applied to
  pre-training inductive biases in representation learning models. The
  synesthetic content of interest is the shared activations among
  different sensory stimuli common to an experience. Since the encoding
  of sense modalities varies due to differences in biological and neural
  pathways, it can more generally be described as the invariants of
  morphisms between initial and terminal activations of different sense
  modalities. Through synesthetic sensory interactions with various
  objects and environments, agents develop a collection of invariant
  representations that span all sense modalities and phenomenal range.
  This forms a category that can be de-contextualized from particular
  objects into its own entity of perception with a phenomenology
  comparable to the subtle body. We can formalize this object through
  category theory as a Skeleton category that combinds and reduces
  invariants from pointed categories of various initial and terminal
  activations. More specifically using representation theory, we
  describe the object as a quiver gauge theory and explore its
  implementation in a geometric deep learning framework with steerable
  graph neural networks, mechanistic interpretability experiments, and
  predictive inference with conformal prediction.
