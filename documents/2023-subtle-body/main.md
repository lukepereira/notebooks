  The grounding of concepts in an embodied intelligence appears to
  involve domains like intuition, felt-sense, and emotions. It is
  proposed that these domains are developed from multi-modal sense
  samples of our perception. In particular, certain objects stimulate
  multiple sense doors, like the simultaneous experience of smell,
  taste, touch while eating a fruit. The synesthetic experience of
  interest is the intersection and not just the union of different
  activation sets from different sense doors. Since the encoding of
  senses varies intrinisically varies because of differences in
  biological pathways, this can more generally be formulated as
  invariants of morphisms between encoded sensory samples. Through
  various sensory interactions objects in the world, agents develop a
  spanning structure of these invariant representations of synesthetic
  perception. This forms a category that can be de-contextualized from
  particular objects into its own entity of perception. We can formalize
  this in representation theory as the irreducible representations that
  are common between different latent encodings of samples from an
  object as they are encoded. This encoding can be reduced to as a union
  of (Lie group) manifolds. More broadly, the collection of invariants
  can be described as a Skeleton category. This category of synesthetic
  invariants has phenomenology comparable to the "subtle body\" in
  Buddhist writings. The subtle (or energy) body is a non-physical
  object of meditation that is manipulated during various practices,
  often producing altered states and generating insights. This
  disruption of a spanning body schema is comparable to disruption of
  GCPRs (mediating various sense perceptions) in psychedelics, which
  also appears to disrupt predictive coding hierarchies and causes
  altered states. Moreover, the refinement of the subtle body and
  perception itself is at forefront of Buddhist ethics, in contrast to a
  focus on causality in Western ethics. This leads to the proposal that
  the described system can be involved in the alignment of artificial
  intelligence.
