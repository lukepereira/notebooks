History of Cryptography {#history-of-cryptography .unnumbered}
=======================

<span>2</span>

The word cryptography, derived from the Greek words kryptós, meaning
“hidden”, and graphein, meaning “writing”, can broadly be understood as
such - it is the practice of hiding the meaning or content of
communications. More precisely, an encrypted message is typically made
to be indistinguishable from random noise in an effort to prevent a
third party adversary or the general public from ascertaining any useful
information from the original private message.

In 1883, the Dutch cryptographer Auguste Kerckhoffs formulated six
design axioms for military ciphers. They are now known as Kerckhoffs’
principles \[1\] and are expressed as follows:

1.  The system must be practically, if not mathematically,
    indecipherable;

2.  It should not require secrecy, and it should not be a problem if it
    falls into enemy hands;

3.  It must be possible to communicate and remember the key without
    using written notes, and correspondents must be able to change or
    modify it at will;

4.  It must be applicable to telegraph communications;

5.  It must be portable, and should not require several persons to
    handle or operate;

6.  Lastly, the system must be easy to use and should not be stressful
    or require its users to know and comply with a long list of rules.

The second principle has proven to be particularly important in modern
cryptosystems and their use of secret keys. It expresses the notion that
despite an attacker’s access to or familiarity with a cryptosystem, it
is critical that they are still unable to determine a given message
without solving for a computationally infeasible problem.

A cryptosystem can be more rigorously described with the following sets
and functions \[2\]:

-   $\Sigma$: The alphabet

    i.e. $\Sigma=\{a,...,Z,0,...,9\}$ or $\Sigma=\{0,1\}$

-   $M \subseteq \Sigma^*$: the message space

-   $C \subseteq \Sigma^*$: the cyphertext space

-   $K$: the keyspace

-   $\forall e \in K, E_e(x):M \to C$

    $E_e(x)$ is a bijective encryption function

-   $\forall d \in K, D_d(x):C\to M$

    $D_d(x)$ is a bijective decryption function

-   $ \forall e \in K, \exists d \in K$ such that $D_d=E_e^{-1}$

    That is, $\forall m \in M, D_d(E_e(m))=m$

The proliferation of computers and communications systems has inspired
an urgent demand to protect information in digital forms from an
increasingly computationally powerful adversary. A groundbreaking
development came in 1976 with the work of Diffie and Hellman \[3\] and
their revolutionary concept of “public-key cryptography” and an
ingenious method for a key exchange, the security of which relies on the
infeasibility of the discrete logarithm problem. Then in 1978, Rivest,
Shamir, and Adleman discovered the first complete public-key encryption
and signature scheme, now known as RSA \[4\]. The RSA algorithm also
relies on a mathematically hard problem, the infeasibility of factoring
large integers.

Diffie and Helman:\
‘New Directions in Cryptography’ {#diffie-and-helman-new-directions-in-cryptography .unnumbered}
================================

The conceptualization of the public-key cryptosystem, briefly described
above, laid the foundation for the development of the RSA method. The
1978 paper directly motivated the RSA research, since Diffie and Helman
had presented the idea but did not formulate any practical
implementation of a concrete system.

In particular, Diffie and Hellman introduced the concept of “trap-door
one-way” functions $E$ and $D$, to be used for encryption and
decryption, but did not present any examples. These functions are
considered “one-way” because they are easy to compute in one direction
but are very difficult to compute in the other direction. They are
referred to as “trapdoor” functions because the inverse functions are in
fact easy to compute after certain secret “trap-door” information is
known.

The RSA Method {#the-rsa-method .unnumbered}
==============

Suppose that we have A and B (also known as Alice and Bob) who are two
users of a public-key cryptosystem.

            (unsecured channel)
      Alice -----+-----+------- Bob
                 |     |
                 |     |
                 |    Mallory 
                 |    (malicious attacker)
                Eve 
               (eavesdropper)
             

Alice creates a public and private key pair $(k_e, k_d)$ which have the
feature that knowing one does not easily lead to knowing the other.
Alice publishes her public key $k_e$ and keeps her private key securely
hidden. $k_e$ and $k_d$ are inverses with respect to the
$RSA(key, message)$ function, that is

$$\text{RSA}(k_d, \text{RSA}(k_e, m))$$

$= \text{RSA}(k_e, \text{RSA}(k_d, m))$

$=m \qquad \qquad \qquad \quad \quad \ $

To compute these public and private keys,

-   Alice chooses two large primes, $p,q \in \mathbb{Z}$ and some value
    $e \in \mathbb{Z}$ which is relatively prime to $(p-1)(q-1)$.

-   Next, Alice finds a natural number $d$ such that
    $e\cdot d \equiv 1 \mod{(p-1)(q-1)}$.

-   Alice now has private key $(pq,d)$ and public key $(pq,e)$.

To encrypt/decrypt a shared message,

-   Suppose Bob has a message $M \in \mathbb{N}$ and wants to encrypt
    and send it to Alice.

-   Bob computes $ C \equiv M ^ e \pmod{pq}$ and sends the encrypted
    message C to Alice.

-   Alice computes $M \equiv C^d \pmod{pq}$, Bob’s decrypted message.

Theorems and Identities {#theorems-and-identities .unnumbered}
=======================

The proof of correctness provided in the RSA paper relies on Fermat’s
Little Theorem, which states that if $p$ is prime and $p$ does not
divide an integer $a$ then, $$a^{p-1} \equiv 1 {\ (\text{mod}\ p)}$$ and
an identity from Euler’s theorem, which states that if $n$ and $M$ (a
message in our case) are coprime positive integers, then $$\label{eq:1}
M ^{\varphi(n)} \equiv 1 {\ (\text{mod}\ n)}$$ where $\varphi(n)$ is
Euler’s Totient function. $\varphi(n)$ gives the number of positive
integers less than $n$ which are relatively prime to $n$. The following
properties of the Euler totient function are applied:

for prime numbers $p$, $$\varphi(p) = p-1$$

and if $n = pq$, then $$\begin{aligned}
\varphi(n) &= \varphi(p) \cdot \varphi(q) \nonumber\\
&= (p-1)\cdot(q-1) \\ \label{eq2}
&= n - (p+q) +1 \nonumber\end{aligned}$$

Also, since $d$ is relatively prime to $\varphi(n)$, it must have a
multiplicative inverse $e$ such that $$\label{eq:3}
e\cdot d \equiv 1 {\ (\text{mod}\ \varphi(n))}$$

Proof Of Correctness {#proof-of-correctness .unnumbered}
====================

Recall that the encryption and decryption algorithms E and D for a
message M and a cyphertext C are:

$$\begin{aligned}
C \equiv E(M) &\equiv M^e \pmod{n}, \nonumber\\
D(C) &\equiv C^d \pmod{n}. \nonumber\end{aligned}$$

We can prove that deciphering works correctly if $e$ and $d$ are chosen
as shown previously, by proving that the following equations hold:
$$\label{eq:4}
D(E(M) = M.$$ $$\label{eq:5}
E(D(M) = M.$$

So, $$\begin{aligned}
D(E(M) \equiv (E(M))^d &\equiv (M^e)^d{\ (\text{mod}\ n)} \\
&=M^{e\cdot d} {\ (\text{mod}\ n)} \\
E(D(M)) \equiv (D(M))^e &\equiv (M^d)^e{\ (\text{mod}\ n)} \\
&=M^{e\cdot d} {\ (\text{mod}\ n)}\end{aligned}$$

We know that $M^{e\cdot d} $ can equivalently be expressed as
$M^{k\cdot\varphi(n)+1}{\ (\text{mod}\ n)}$ for some $k\in \mathbb{Z}$.
From $(1)$, we see that for all $M$ such that $p$ does not divide $M$,
$$M^{p-1} \equiv 1 {\ (\text{mod}\ p)}$$ and since $(p - 1)$ divides
$\varphi(n)$, we have
$$M^{k\cdot\varphi(n)+1} \equiv M {\ (\text{mod}\ p)}.$$ A similar
argument follows for prime $q$,
$$M^{k\cdot\varphi(n)+1} \equiv M {\ (\text{mod}\ q)} .$$ This is
trivially true when $M \equiv 0 {\ (\text{mod}\ p)}.$ Therefore, the
previous two equations together imply that for all $M$,
$$M^{e\cdot d} \equiv M^{k\cdot\varphi(n)+1} \equiv M {\ (\text{mod}\ q)} .$$

This implies the encryption/decryption equations (4) and (5) hold for
all $M$, $0 \leq M < n$. Therefore E and D are inverse functions.

Unprovable Security {#unprovable-security .unnumbered}
===================

The security of the RSA cryptosystem rests on the difficulty of
factoring large numbers and what is known as the RSA problem. The RSA
problem is defined as the task of recovering a value $M$ such that
$C \equiv M^e {\ (\text{mod}\ n)}$, where $(n, e)$ is an RSA public key
and $C$ is the cyphertext. To break RSA, an attacker would need to
recover the prime factors of $n$ into $p$ and $q$, and compute
$lcm(p - 1, q - 1)$, allowing for the determination of $d$ from $e$.

Full decryption of an RSA ciphertext is thought to be infeasible on the
assumption that both of these problems are hard and that no such
polynomial-time algorithm for factoring large integers on a classical
computer has yet been found, though it has not been proven that none
exists.

Modern Applications:\
Digital Signing and Key Exchange {#modern-applications-digital-signing-and-key-exchange .unnumbered}
================================

Suppose Alice wants to send a signed message to Bob such that Bob can
verify the origin of the message. A hash function, which is a one way
function from a large finite strings to a smaller, fixed length string
can be used to produce a hash value of the message. Alice can encrypt
this value with her private key and attach it as a “signature” to the
message. Bob can use the same hash algorithm in conjunction with Alice’s
public key to decrypt and compare it with the message’s actual hash
value. If the two values agree, he knows that the author of the message
was in possession of Alice’s private key, and that the message has not
been tampered with, since any modification would result in a different
hash value.

Unfortunately, RSA calculations tend to be too time consuming for most
communication purposes and decryption of large messages becomes
intolerably expensive. This is common for what’s known as asymmetric
encryption, where the encryption and decryption keys differ. Typically
RSA is used to exchange a session key for a more efficient algorithm
which uses symmetric keys where ’essentially’ the same key is used to
encrypt and decrypt, like Data Encryption Standard (DES) and Cipher
Block Chaining (CBC).
