\begin{verse}
His power lies in his sight \\
of futures splayed in his head \\
the flatlander stares into light \\
flowing from quartz edge \\
he sees the rainbow of time \\
and walks his spectral line \\
with phantoms of the dead \\
laying supine on his bed \\

\begin{verse}
It was a long way coming from plains far away \\
the sun of all colour shakes on the horizon \\
the morning hummed in with the sound of a truck \\
passing on a highway behind him \\
a crow’s croak echoed in the back of his throat \\
as his room finally invites the light in \\ 
now he could see the high walls and the ceiling \\
broken beams of pink and violet \\
the insomniac man lies tossing and turning \\
begging his mind to be quieted \\ 
from thinking up stories so complex and boring \\
that they required to be cited \\

\begin{verse}
If from the public path you turn your step \\
long will you wander to return here \\
I say these words with a wideness of breadth \\
I sing this song very clear \\
In my life i have known no wise man \\
only inadvertent teacher \\
In my time I have known no great man \\
only corrupted leader \\
little did I live in this world to learn \\
good deeds are not rewarded but are occasionally punished \\
If from the public path you turn your steps \\
you will be lead to great summits \\
but if from your duty you turn your head \\
your mind in turn will be turned into rubbish \\ 
\end{verse}
\begin{verse}
I am just a voice in a box \\
I am words on a page \\
my jawbone cuts like sharpened emerald \\
my mind is becoming unchained \\
i am just a door to a lock \\
i am track gauges for a train \\
\end{verse}
\begin{verse}
If from the public path you turn your steps \\
long will you wander to return here \\
I say these words without humerous intent\\
I warn these words are severe\\
I am neither scholar nor a scientist\\
I’m not a prophet or a seer\\
I learned these thoughts from a script that was swept\\
under the rug for many years \\
I learned these words from my personal experience\\
but shard from the same stone I see we’re\\
In my time i've seen randomness debased\\
my life has been turned into fiction\\
there are few i know who can relate\\
some religious and the mystics\\
a child runs wild through a library\\
picks up a book and turns to a page\\
and on that page he points to a phrase\\
and by god it rings true\\
\end{verse}
\begin{verse}
my mind is unraveling \\
my mind is unchained \\
I am just a voice in a box\\
words on an unreal page\\
My jawbone cuts like sharpened emerald\\
but my mind has gone insane\\
I am just a door without locks\\
I am train tracks without a gauge\\

\begin{verse}
A body been whipped and fell to whats paved \\
aching from work and in pain \\
A police man came to write a fine to his name \\
for sleeping in the cyclist lane \\
a teenager taped but the man did not wake\\
so they deleted what won't entertain\\
A sleepwalker slain shook his head in disdain\\
claiming the man felt no pain\\
A doctor that's trained to place nature at blame\\
prescribe new pills and call him insane\\
A drug addled brain felt a rupture in planes\\
but can't see their sights as the same\\
A celebrity waned through crowds from her fame\\
thought only of delusions she creates\\
A priest in vain prays a phrase from a page \\
about ways that have gone out of date \\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
When i die let my body be lined \\
along with the working class hero \\
Don't cry my child remember you shine \\
from virtue of nearness to zero \\
In your mind may you celebrate \\
all that you have cultivated\\
from the ghettos among poor \\
may you shine in splendour\\
\end{verse}
\begin{verse}
For those with black grease in the crease of your palms; \\
i speak this psalm \\
For all of the lot eating  in parking lots; \\
i speak this song \\
For those on the bus who sleep near heat without fuss; \\
i wish u good luck \\
For those shackled in debt with life sentences set; \\
i pray the taxman forgets \\
For the mothers who wring their hands in the sink; \\
may you find your time to think \\
For the artist torn apart by the cause in their heart; \\
may you live on like mozart \\
\end{verse}
\begin{verse}
When I die let my body writhe \\
along with the working class hero \\
Don't cry my child let me remind \\
you shine from virtue of nearness to zero\\
In your mind may you celebrate \\
all that you have cultivated\\
From the ghettos among poor \\
may you shine with splendour \\
