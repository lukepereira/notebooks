<h1 class="title">High school verses</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>His power lies in his sight<br />
of futures splayed in his head<br />
the flatlander stares into light<br />
flowing from quartz edge<br />
he sees the rainbow of time<br />
and walks his spectral line<br />
with phantoms of the dead<br />
laying supine on his bed<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It was a long way coming from plains far away<br />
the sun of all colour shakes on the horizon<br />
the morning hummed in with the sound of a truck<br />
passing on a highway behind him<br />
a crow’s croak echoed in the back of his throat<br />
as his room finally invites the light in<br />
now he could see the high walls and the ceiling<br />
broken beams of pink and violet<br />
the insomniac man lies tossing and turning<br />
begging his mind to be quieted<br />
from thinking up stories so complex and boring<br />
that they required to be cited<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If from the public path you turn your step<br />
long will you wander to return here<br />
I say these words with a wideness of breadth<br />
I sing this song very clear<br />
In my life i have known no wise man<br />
only inadvertent teacher<br />
In my time I have known no great man<br />
only corrupted leader<br />
little did I live in this world to learn<br />
good deeds are not rewarded but are occasionally punished<br />
If from the public path you turn your steps<br />
you will be lead to great summits<br />
but if from your duty you turn your head<br />
your mind in turn will be turned into rubbish<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I am just a voice in a box<br />
I am words on a page<br />
my jawbone cuts like sharpened emerald<br />
my mind is becoming unchained<br />
i am just a door to a lock<br />
i am track gauges for a train<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If from the public path you turn your steps<br />
long will you wander to return here<br />
I say these words without humerous intent<br />
I warn these words are severe<br />
I am neither scholar nor a scientist<br />
I’m not a prophet or a seer<br />
I learned these thoughts from a script that was swept<br />
under the rug for many years<br />
I learned these words from my personal experience<br />
but shard from the same stone I see we’re<br />
In my time i’ve seen randomness debased<br />
my life has been turned into fiction<br />
there are few i know who can relate<br />
some religious and the mystics<br />
a child runs wild through a library<br />
picks up a book and turns to a page<br />
and on that page he points to a phrase<br />
and by god it rings true<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>my mind is unraveling<br />
my mind is unchained<br />
I am just a voice in a box<br />
words on an unreal page<br />
My jawbone cuts like sharpened emerald<br />
but my mind has gone insane<br />
I am just a door without locks<br />
I am train tracks without a gauge<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A body been whipped and fell to whats paved<br />
aching from work and in pain<br />
A police man came to write a fine to his name<br />
for sleeping in the cyclist lane<br />
a teenager taped but the man did not wake<br />
so they deleted what won’t entertain<br />
A sleepwalker slain shook his head in disdain<br />
claiming the man felt no pain<br />
A doctor that’s trained to place nature at blame<br />
prescribe new pills and call him insane<br />
A drug addled brain felt a rupture in planes<br />
but can’t see their sights as the same<br />
A celebrity waned through crowds from her fame<br />
thought only of delusions she creates<br />
A priest in vain prays a phrase from a page<br />
about ways that have gone out of date<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When i die let my body be lined<br />
along with the working class hero<br />
Don’t cry my child remember you shine<br />
from virtue of nearness to zero<br />
In your mind may you celebrate<br />
all that you have cultivated<br />
from the ghettos among poor<br />
may you shine in splendour<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For those with black grease in the crease of your palms;<br />
i speak this psalm<br />
For all of the lot eating in parking lots;<br />
i speak this song<br />
For those on the bus who sleep near heat without fuss;<br />
i wish u good luck<br />
For those shackled in debt with life sentences set;<br />
i pray the taxman forgets<br />
For the mothers who wring their hands in the sink;<br />
may you find your time to think<br />
For the artist torn apart by the cause in their heart;<br />
may you live on like mozart<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When I die let my body writhe<br />
along with the working class hero<br />
Don’t cry my child let me remind<br />
you shine from virtue of nearness to zero<br />
In your mind may you celebrate<br />
all that you have cultivated<br />
From the ghettos among poor<br />
may you shine with splendour<br />
</p>
