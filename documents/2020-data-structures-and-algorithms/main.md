Pre-requisite Concepts
======================

Asymptotic Runtime Analysis
---------------------------

### Big O

We can measure the growth rate of the time or space complexity of an
algorithm using an upper bound (${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(f)$), lower
bound ($\Omega (f) $) or a tight bound ($\Theta (f)$) on the best, worse
or average case run time. When analysing an algorithm we typically use
an upper bound on the worst case.
$${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(1) \leq {\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(\log n) \leq {\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n) \leq {\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n \log n) \leq {\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n^2) \leq  {\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(2^n)  \leq {\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n!)$$

<span>2</span>

-   ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(1)$ - constant time

-   ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(\log(n))$ - logarithmic time

-   ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}((\log(n))c)$ - polylogarithmic time

-   ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n)$ - linear time

-   ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n^2)$ - quadratic time

-   ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n^c)$ - polynomial time

-   ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(c^n)$ - exponential time

-   ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n!)$ - factorial time

### Amortized Analysis

If the cost of an action has high variance, i.e. its computation is
often inexpensive but is occasionally expensive, we can capture its
expected behaviour using an amortized time value. If we let $T(n)$
represent the amount of work the algorithm does on an input of size $n$,
An operation has amortized cost $T(n)$ if $k$ operations cost
$\leq k \cdot T(n)$. $T(n)$ being amortized roughly means $T(n)$ is
averaged over all possible operations.

For example, a dynamic array will copy over elements to an array of
double its size whenever an insert is called on an already full
instance, otherwise it will simply insert the new element. For $X$
insertions, this happens every $2, 4, 8, ..., X$ insertions.
$$T(n) = {\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}( c + \frac{c}{2} + \frac{c}{4} + \cdots) 
        = {\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(2c) 
        = {\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(1)$$

A data structure realizing an amortized complexity of
${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(f(n))$ is less performant than one with a
worst-case complexity is ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(f(n))$, since a
very expensive operation might still occur, but it is better than an
algorithm with an average-case complexity
${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(f(n))$, since the amortized bound will
achieve this average on any input.

### Logarithmic Runtime

When encountering an algorithm in which the number of elements in the
problem space is halved on each step, i.e. in a divide and conquer
solution like binary search, the algorithm will likely have a
${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(\log n)$ or
${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n \log n)$ run-time. We can think of
${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n \log n)$ as doing $\log n$ work $n$ times.

Again, if we let $T(n)$ represent the amount of work the algorithm does
on an input of size $n$, $$\begin{aligned}
        T(n) &= T(n/2) + \Theta(1) \\
        &=  T(n/4)+ \Theta(1) + \Theta(1) \\ 
        &= \Theta(1) + \cdots + \Theta(1) \\
        &= \Theta(\log n ) 
    \end{aligned}$$

When using Python’s standard library sort on an array, we can assume the
running time will be ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n \log n)$. See section
on Timsort for further details.

Computational Complexity
------------------------

### Complexity Classes

$$P \subseteq NP \subseteq EXP \subseteq R$$

1.  $P$: The set of problems that can be solved in polynomial time.

2.  $NP$: The set of decision problems that can be solved in
    non-deterministic polynomial time via a “lucky” algorithm.

3.  $EXP$: The set of problems that can be solved in exponential time.

4.  $R$: The set of problems that can be solved in finite time.

### NP Problems

Nondeterminsitic Polynomial (NP) problems follow a nondeterministic
model in which an algorithm makes guesses and produce a binary output of
YES or NO. These are the simplest interesting class of problems and are
known as decision problems. A “lucky” algorithm can make guesses which
are always correct without having to attempt all options. In other
words, $NP$ is the set of decision problems with solutions that can be
verified in polynomial time. This means that when an answer is YES, it
can be proved and a polynomial-time algorithm can verify the proof.

P vs. NP asks whether generating proofs of solutions is harder than
checking, i.e whether every problem whose solution can be quickly
verified can also be solved quickly. NP-hard problems are those at least
as hard as all NP problems. NP-hard problems need not be in NP; that is,
they may not have solutions verifiable in polynomial time. NP-complete
problems are a set of problems to each of which any other NP-problem can
be reduced in polynomial time and whose solution may still be verified
in polynomial time. In fact, NP-complete = NP $\cap$ NP-hard.

### Reductions

A reduction is an algorithm for transforming one problem into another
problem for which a solution or analysis already exists (instead of
solving it from scratch). A sufficiently efficient reduction from one
problem to another may be used to show that the second problem is at
least as difficult as the first.

NP-complete problems are all interreducible using polynomial-time
reductions (same difficulty). This implies that we can use reductions to
prove NP-hardness. A one-call reduction is a polynomial time algorithm
that constructs an instance of $X$ from an instance $Y$ so that their
optimal values are equal, i.e. $X$ problem $\implies$ $Y$ problem
$\implies$ $Y$ solution $\implies$ $X$ solution. Multicall reductions
instead solve $X$ using free calls to $Y$ — in this sense, every
algorithm reduces the problem and model of computation.

Algorithm Design
----------------

### In-place algorithm

An in-place algorithm is an algorithm which transforms input using no
auxiliary data structure, though a small amount of extra storage space
is allowed for a constant number of auxiliary variables. The input is
usually overwritten by the output (mutated) as the algorithm executes.
An in-place algorithm updates input sequence only through replacement or
swapping of elements.

### Space–time tradeoff

A space–time or time–memory trade-off is a case where an algorithm
trades increased space usage with decreased time complexity. Here, space
refers to the data storage consumed in performing a given task (RAM,
HDD, etc), and time refers to the time consumed in performing a given
task (computation time or response time).

### Heuristics

A heuristic is a technique designed for solving a problem more quickly
when classic methods are too slow, or for finding an approximate
solution when classic methods fail to find any exact solution. This is
achieved by trading optimality, completeness, accuracy, or precision for
speed. In a way, it can be considered a shortcut.

### Hash Functions

A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of
arbitrary size to fixed-size values. The values returned by a hash
function are called hash values, hash codes, digests, or simply hashes.
A good hash function satisfies two basic properties: it should be very
fast to compute; it should minimize duplication of output values
(**collisions**). For many use cases, it is useful for every hash value
in the output range to be generated with roughly the same probability.
Two of the most common hash algorithms are the MD5 (Message-Digest
algorithm 5) and the SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm).

Data Structures and ADTs
========================

An **abstract data type (ADT)** is a theoretical model of an entity and
the set of operations that can be performed on that entity

A **data structure** is a value in a program which can be used to store
and operate on data, i.e. it is a programmed implementation of an ADT.

**Contiguously-allocated structures** are composed of single slabs of
memory, and include arrays, matrices, heaps, and hash tables.

**Linked data structures** are composed of distinct chunks of memory
bound together by pointers, and include lists, trees, and graph
adjacency lists. Recall, a pointer is a reference to a memory address
which stores some data.

Lists and Arrays
----------------

### List

A list is an abstract data type that represents a countable number of
ordered values, where the same value may occur more than once. Lists are
a basic example of containers, as they contain other values. Their
operations include the following,

-   **isEmpty(L)**: test whether or not the list is empty;

-   **prepend(L, item)**: prepend an entity to the list

-   **append(L, item)**: append an entity to the list

-   **get(L, i)**: access the element at a given index.

-   **head(L)**: determine the first component (head) of the list

-   **tail(L)**: refer to the list consisting of all the components of a
    list except for its first (tail).

### Arrays

An array is a data structure implementing a list ADT, consisting of a
collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at
least one array index or key.

### Dynamic Arrays

A dynamic array is a data structure that allocates all elements
contiguously in memory and keeps a count of the current number of
elements. If the space reserved for the dynamic array is exceeded, it is
reallocated and (possibly) copied, which is an expensive operation.

### Linked Lists

A linked list is a data structure that represents a sequence of nodes.
In a singly linked list each node maintains a pointer to the next node
in the linked list. A doubly linked list gives each node pointers to
both the next node and the previous node. Unlike an array, a linked list
does not provide constant time access to a particular “index” within the
list, i.e. to access the $K$th index you will need to iterate through
$K$ elements. The benefit of a linked list is that inserting and
removing items from the beginning of the list can be done in constant
time. For specific applications, this can be useful. Linked structures
can have poor cache performance compared with arrays. Maintaining a
sorted linked list is costly and not usually worthwhile since we cannot
perform binary searches.

*Python Implementation*

``` {.python language="Python"}
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
```

### Self-Organizing Lists

A self-organizing list is a list that reorders its elements based on
some self-organizing heuristic to improve average access time. The aim
of a self-organizing list is to improve efficiency of linear search by
moving more frequently accessed items towards the head of the list. A
self-organizing list achieves near constant time for element access in
the best case and uses a reorganizing algorithm to adapt to various
query distributions at runtime.

### Skip Lists

As an alternative to balanced trees examined later, a hierarchy of
sorted linked lists is maintained, where a random variable is associated
to each element to decide whether it gets copied into the next highest
list. This implies roughly $\log n$ lists, each roughly half as large as
the one above it. A search starts in the smallest list. The search key
lies in an interval between two elements, which is then explored in the
next larger list. Each searched interval contains an expected constant
number of elements per list, for a total expected
${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(\log n)$ query time. The primary benefits of
skip lists are ease of analysis and implementation relative to balanced
trees.

Stacks and Queues
-----------------

### Stacks

A stack is an ADT container that uses last-in first-out (LIFO) ordering,
i.e. the most recent item added to the stack is the first item to be
removed. It supports the following operations:

-   **pop()**: Remove the top item from the stack.

-   **push(item)**: Add an item to the top of the stack.

-   **peek()**: Return the top of the stack.

-   **isEmpty()**: Return true if and only if the stack is empty.

Unlike an array, a stack does not offer constant-time access to the
$i$th item. However, it does allow constant time adds and removes as it
doesn’t require shifting elements around. One case where stacks are
often useful is in certain recursive algorithms where we need to push
temporary data onto a stack as we recurse and then remove them as we
backtrack (for example, because the recursive check failed). A stack
offers an intuitive way to do this. A stack can also be used to
implement a recursive algorithm iteratively which is what’s otherwise
done in a function’s call stack.

### Queues

A queue is an ADT container that implements FIFO (first-in first-out)
ordering, i.e. items are removed in the same order that they are added.
It supports the following operations:

-   **push(item)**: Add an item to the end of the queue.

-   **popLeft()**: Remove and return the first item in the queue.

-   **peek()**: Return the top of the queue.

-   **isEmpty()**: Return true if the queue is empty.

One place where queues are often used is in breadth-first search or in
implementing a cache. In breadth-first search we may use a queue to
store a list of the nodes that we need to process. Each time we process
a node, we add its adjacent nodes to the back of the queue. This allows
us to process nodes in the order in which they are viewed.

A queue can be implemented with a linked list and moreover, they are
essentially the same thing as long as items are added and removed from
opposite sides.

*Python Implementation*

``` {.python language="Python"}
# Using a list 
q = []
for item in data:
    q.append(item) 

while len(q):
    next_item = queue.pop(0)
    print(next_item)

# The collections.deque module 
from collections import deque 

q = deque() 
for item in data:
    q.append(item) 
 
while len(q):
    next_item = q.popleft() 
    print(next_item)
```

### Priority Queue

A priority queue is an ADT container that retrieves items not by the
insertion time (as in a stack or queue), nor by a key match (as in a
dictionary), but instead retrieves items with the highest priority
value. Priority queues provide more flexibility than simple sorting
because they allow new elements to enter a system at arbitrary
intervals. It is much more cost-effective to insert a new job into a
priority queue than to re-sort everything on each such arrival. The
basic priority queue supports three primary operations:

-   **insert(Q, x)**: Given an item x with key k, insert it into the
    priority queue Q.

-   **findMinimum(Q)** or **findMaximum(Q)**: Return a pointer to the
    item whose key value is smaller (larger) than any other key in the
    priority queue Q.

-   **deleteMinimum(Q)** or **deleteMaximum(Q)**: Remove the item from
    the priority queue Q whose key is minimum (maximum).

There are several choices in which underlying data structures can be
used for a basic priority queue implementation:

1.  Sorted arrays are very efficient in both identifying the smallest
    element and deleting it by decrementing the top index. However,
    maintaining the total order makes inserting new elements slow.
    Sorted arrays are only suitable when there will be few insertions
    into the priority queue.

2.  Binary heaps are the right answer when the upper bound on the number
    of items in your priority queue is known, since you must specify
    array size at creation time. Though this constraint can be mitigated
    by using dynamic arrays

3.  Bounded height priority queue

4.  Binary search trees make effective priority queues, since the
    smallest element is always the leftmost leaf, while the largest
    element is always the rightmost leaf. The min (max) is found by
    simply tracing down left (right) pointers until the next pointer
    is nil. Binary tree heaps prove most appropriate when you need other
    dictionary operations, or if you have an unbounded key range and do
    not know the maximum priority queue size in advance.

5.  Fibonacci and pairing heaps. These complicated priority queues are
    designed to speed up decrease-key operations, where the priority of
    an item already in the priority queue is reduced. This arises, for
    example, in shortest path computations when we discover a shorter
    route to a vertex v than previously established.

*Python Implementation*

``` {.python language="Python"}
# The queue module
from Queue import PriorityQueue

q = PriorityQueue()
for item in data:
    q.put((item.priority, item))

while not q.empty():
    next_item = q.get()
    print(next_item)

# The heapq module
import heapq

q = []
for item in data:
    heapq.heappush(q, (item.priority, item))

while q:
    next_item = heapq.heappop(q)
    print(next_item)
```

Trees
-----

A tree is an ADT composed of nodes such that there is a root node with
zero or more child nodes where each child node also has zero or more
child nodes and can be recursively defined as a root node of a sub-tree.
Since there are no edges between sibling nodes, a tree cannot contain
cycles. Furthermore, nodes can be given a particular order, can have any
data type as values, and they may or may not have links back to their
parent nodes.

A **binary tree** is a tree in which each node has up to two children. A
**binary search tree** is a binary tree in which every node $n$ follows
a specific ordering property: all left descendants $\leq n <$ all right
descendants. A **complete** binary tree is a binary tree in which every
level of the tree is filled, except for perhaps the last level and all
of the nodes in the bottom level are as far to the left as possible. A
**full** binary tree is a binary tree in which every node has either
zero or two children. A **perfect** binary tree is one that is both full
and complete.

A complete tree with $n$ nodes has $\lceil \log n \rceil$ height. There
is no ambiguity about where the ”empty“ spots in a complete tree are so
we do not need to use up space to store references between nodes, as we
do in a standard binary tree implementation. This means that we can
store its nodes inside an array. For a node corresponding to index $i$,
its left child is stored at index $2i$, and its right child is stored at
index $2i + 1$. Going backwards, we can also deduce that the parent of
index $i$ (when $i > 1$) is stored at index $\lceil i/2 \rceil$.

*Python Implementation*

``` {.python language="Python"}
# Generic tree
from collections import defaultdict

## a tree is a dict whose default values are trees. 
tree = lambda: defaultdict(tree)

# Object-oriented binary tree
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
```

### Binary Heaps

The **heap property** states that the key stored in each node is either
greater than or equal to or less than or equal to the keys in the node’s
children, according to some total order. A **min-heap** is a complete
binary tree (filled other than the rightmost elements on the last level)
where each node is smaller than its children. The root, therefore, is
the minimum element in the tree. The converse holds for a **max-heap**.
We have two key operations on a heap:

-   **insert(x)**: When we insert into a min-heap, we always start by
    inserting the element at the bottom. We insert at the rightmost spot
    so as to maintain the complete tree property. Then, we maintain the
    heap property by swapping the new element with its parent until we
    find an appropriate spot for the element. We essentially bubble up
    the minimum element. This takes ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(\log n)$
    time, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the heap.

-   **findMin()** or **findMax()**: Finding the minimum element of a
    min-heap is inexpensive since it will always be at the top. The
    challenging part is how to remove it while maintaining the
    heap property. First, we remove the minimum element and swap it with
    the last element in the heap (the bottommost, rightmost element).
    Then, we bubble down this element, swapping it with one of its
    children until the minheap property is restored. This algorithm will
    also take ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}( \log n)$ time.

A heap will be better at findMin/findMax
(${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(1)$), while a BST is performant at all
finds (${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(\log n)$). A heap is especially good
at basic ordering and keeping track of max and mins.

*Python Implementation*

``` {.python language="Python"}
# Using heapq module
import heapq

listForTree = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]    

## min heap
heapq.heapify(listForTree)            
heapq.heappop(minheap)      

class MinHeap(object):
  def __init__(self): self.h = []
  def heappush(self, x): heapq.heappush(self.h, x)
  def heappop(self): return heapq.heappop(self.h)
  def __getitem__(self, i): return self.h[i]
  def __len__(self): return len(self.h)

## max heap
heapq._heapify_max(listForTree)       
heapq._heappop_max(maxheap)

  def __init__(self, val): self.val = val
  def __lt__(self, other): 
    """Invert comparison logic"""
    return self.val > other.val
  
class MaxHeap(MinHeap):
  def heappush(self, x): heapq.heappush(self.h, MaxHeapObj(x))
  def heappop(self): return heapq.heappop(self.h).val
  def __getitem__(self, i): return self.h[i].val


# Max heap full implementation
class MaxHeap:
    def __init__(self, items=[]):
        self.heap = [0]
        for i in items:
            self.heap.append(i)
            self.__floatUp(len(self.heap) - 1)

    def push(self, data):
        self.heap.append(data)
        self.__floatUp(len(self.heap) - 1)

    def peek(self):
        if self.heap[1]:
            return self.heap[1]
        else:
            return False

    def pop(self):
        if len(self.heap) > 2:
            self.__swap(1, len(self.heap) - 1)
            maxVal = self.heap.pop()
            self.__bubbleDown(1)
        elif len(self.heap) == 2:
            maxVal = self.heap.pop()
        else:
            maxVal = False
        return maxVal

    def __swap(self, i, j):
        self.heap[i], self.heap[j] = self.heap[j], self.heap[i]

    def __floatUp(self, index):
        parent = index//2
        if index <= 1:
            return
        elif self.heap[index] > self.heap[parent]:
            self.__swap(index, parent)
            self.__floatUp(parent)

    def __bubbleDown(self, index):
        left = index * 2
        right = index * 2 + 1
        largest = index
        if len(self.heap) > left and self.heap[largest] < self.heap[left]:
            largest = left
        if len(self.heap) > right and self.heap[largest] < self.heap[right]:
            largest = right
        if largest != index:
            self.__swap(index, largest)
            self.__bubbleDown(largest)
```

### Tries (Prefix Trees)

A trie is a variant of an n-ary tree in which alphanumeric characters
are stored at each node. Each path down the tree may represent a word.
The \* nodes (sometimes called “null nodes") are often used to indicate
complete words. The actual implementation of these \* nodes might be a
special type of child (such as a TerminatingTrieNode, which inherits
from TrieNode). Or, we could use just a boolean flag terminates within
the “parent" node. A node in a trie could have anywhere from 1 through
ALPHABET\_SIZE + 1 children (or, 0 through ALPHABET\_SIZE if a boolean
flag is used instead of a \* node).

Very commonly, a trie is used to store the entire (English) language for
quick prefix lookups. A trie can check if a string is a valid prefix in
${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(K)$ time, where $K$ is the length of the
string. Many problems involving lists of valid words leverage a trie as
an optimization.

Observe that most of the nodes in a trie-based suffix tree occur on
simple paths between branch nodes in the tree. Each of these simple
paths corresponds to a substring of the original string. By storing the
original string in an array and collapsing each such path into a single
edge, we have all the information of the full suffix tree in only
${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n)$ space. The label for each edge is
described by the starting and ending array indices representing the
substring. Some example use cases are as follows:

-   Find all occurrences of $q$ as a substring of $S$: In collapsed
    suffix trees, it takes ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(|q| + k)$ time to
    find the $k$ occurrences of $q$ in $S$.

-   Longest substring common to a set of strings

-   Find the longest palindrome in $S$

*Python Implementation*

``` {.python language="Python"}
import collections

class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.word = False
        self.children = {}

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()

    def insert(self, word):
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node.children:
                node.children[char] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[char]
        node.word = True

    def search(self, word):
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node.children:
                return False
            node = node.children[char]
        return node.word

    def startsWith(self, prefix):
        node = self.root
        for char in prefix:
            if char not in node.children:
                return False
            node = node.children[char]
        return True
```

### Suffix Trees/Arrays

A special kind of trie, called a suffix tree, can be used to index all
suffixes in a text in order to carry out fast full text searches. The
construction of such a tree for the string $S$ takes linear time and
space relative to the length of $S$. Once constructed, several
operations can be performed quickly, i.e. locating a substring in $S$,
locating a substring if a certain number of mistakes or edits are
allowed, locating matches for a regular expression pattern etc. Suffix
trees also provide one of the first linear-time solutions for the
longest common substring problem. Though these speedups come at a cost:
storing a string’s suffix tree typically requires significantly more
space than storing the string itself.

The suffix tree for the string $S$ of length $n$ is defined as a tree
such that:

1.  The tree has exactly $n$ leaves numbered from $1$ to $n$.

2.  Except for the root, every internal node has at least two children.

3.  Each edge is labelled with a non-empty substring of $S$.

4.  No two edges starting out of a node can have string-labels beginning
    with the same character.

5.  The string obtained by concatenating all the string-labels found on
    the path from the root to leaf $i$ spells out suffix
    $S[i \cdots n]$, for $i$ from $1$ to $n$.

Suffix arrays do most of what suffix trees do, while using roughly four
times less memory. They are also easier to implement. A suffix array is,
in principle, just an array that contains all the $n$ suffixes of $S$ in
sorted order. Thus a binary search of this array for string $q$ suffices
to locate the prefix of a suffix that matches $q$, permitting an
efficient substring search in $O(\log n)$ string comparisons. With the
addition of an index specifying the common prefix length of all bounding
suffixes, only $\log n+|q|$ character comparisons need be performed on
any query, since we can identify the next character that must be tested
in the binary search.

In a suffix array, a suffix is represented completely by its unique
starting position (from $1$ to $n$) and read off as needed using a
single reference copy of the input string. Some care must be taken to
construct suffix arrays efficiently, however, since there are $O(n^2)$
characters in the strings being sorted. One solution is to first build a
suffix tree, then perform an in-order traversal of it to read the
strings off in sorted order. However, more recent breakthroughs have
lead to space/time efficient algorithms for constructing suffix arrays
directly.

### Merkle Trees

A **hash tree** or Merkle tree is a tree in which every leaf node is
labelled with the cryptographic hash of a data block, and every non-leaf
node is labelled with the cryptographic hash of the labels of its child
nodes. Hash trees allow efficient and secure verification of the
contents of large data structures. Hash trees are a generalization of
hash lists and hash chains.

*Python Implementation*

``` {.python language="Python"}
from hashlib import sha256

def hash_(x):
    S = sha256()
    S.update(x)
    return S.hexdigest()

def merkle(node):
    if not node:
        return '#'
    m_left = merkle(node.left)
    m_right = merkle(node.right)
    node.merkle = hash_(m_left + str(node.val) + m_right)
    return node.merkle

# Two trees are identical if the hash of their roots are equal (except for collisions)
def isSubtree(s, t):
    merkle(s)
    merkle(t)
    
    def dfs(node):
        if not node:
            return False
        return (node.merkle == t.merkle or
                dfs(node.left) or dfs(node.right))

    return dfs(s)
```

### Kd-Trees

Kd-trees and related spatial data structures hierarchically decompose
space into a small number of cells, each containing a few
representatives from an input set of points. This provides a fast way to
access any object by position. We traverse down the hierarchy until we
find the smallest cell containing it, and then scan through the objects
in this cell to identify the right one.

Typical algorithms construct kd-trees by partitioning point sets.
Ideally, this plane equally partitions the subset of points into
left/right (or up/down) subsets. Partitioning stops after $\log n$
levels, with each point in its own leaf cell. Each box-shaped region is
defined by $2k$ planes, where $k$ is the number of dimensions. Useful
applications are as follows:

-   Point location – To identify which cell a query point $q$ lies in,
    we start at the root and test which side of the partition plane
    contains $q$.

-   Nearest neighbor search – To find the point in $S$ closest to a
    query point $q$, we perform point location to find the cell $c$
    containing $q$

-   Range search – Which points lie within a query box or region?
    Starting from the root, check whether the query region intersects
    (or contains) the cell defining the current node. If it does, check
    the children; if not, none of the leaf cells below this node can
    possibly be of interest.

-   Partial key search – Suppose we want to find a point p in S, but we
    do not have full information about p. Say we are looking for someone
    of age 35 and height 5’8” but of unknown weight in a 3D-tree with
    dimensions of age, weight, and height. Starting from the root, we
    can identify the correct descendant for all but the weight dimension

Kd-trees are most useful for a small to moderate number of dimensions,
say from 2 up to maybe 20 dimensions. Algorithms that quickly produce a
point provably close to the query point are a recent development in
higher-dimensional nearest neighbor search. A sparse weighted graph
structure is built from the data set, and the nearest neighbor is found
by starting at a random point and walking greedily in the graph towards
the query point.

Self-balancing Trees
--------------------

Balanced search trees use local **rotation operations** to restructure
search trees, moving more distant nodes closer to the root while
maintaining the in-order search structure of the tree. The **balance
factor** of a node in a binary tree is the height of its right subtree
minus the height of its left subtree.

Among balanced search trees, AVL and 2/3 trees are now considered
out-dated while red-black trees seem to be more popular. A particularly
interesting self-organizing data structure is the splay tree, which uses
rotations to move any accessed key to the root. Frequently used or
recently accessed nodes thus sit near the top of the tree, allowing
faster searches

### AVL Tree

An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. A node satisfies the
**AVL invariant** if its balance factor is between -1 and 1. A binary
tree is AVL-balanced if all of its nodes satisfy the AVL invariant, so
we can say that an AVL tree is a binary search tree which is
AVL-balanced.

To maintain the AVL condition, perform an insertion/deletion using the
typical BST algorithm, then if any nodes have the balance factor
invariant violated, restore the invariant. We can simply do so after the
recursive Insert, Delete, ExtractMax, or ExtractMin call. So we go down
the tree to search for the correct spot to insert the node, and then go
back up the tree to restore the AVL invariant. In fact, these
restrictions make it straightforward to define a small set of simple,
constant-time procedures to restructure the tree to restore the balance
factor in these cases. These procedures are called rotations.

The worst-case running time of AVL tree insertion and deletion is
${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(h)$, where $h$ is the height of the tree,
the same as for the naive insertion and deletion algorithms. An AVL tree
with $n$ nodes has height at most $1.44 \log n$. AVL tree insertion,
deletion, and search have worst-case running time $\Theta(\log n)$,
where $n$ is the number of nodes in the tree

### Red–black Tree

A red–black tree is a kind of self-balancing binary search tree. Each
node of the binary tree has an extra bit which is often interpreted as
the color (red or black) of the node. These color bits are used to
ensure the tree remains approximately balanced during insertions and
deletions.

Balance is preserved by painting each node of the tree with one of two
colors in a way that satisfies certain properties, which collectively
constrain how unbalanced the tree can become in the worst case. When the
tree is modified, the new tree is subsequently rearranged and repainted
to restore the coloring properties. The properties are designed in such
a way that this rearranging and recoloring can be performed efficiently.
The balancing of the tree is not perfect, but it is good enough to allow
it to guarantee searching in $O(\log n)$ time.

Properties:

1.  Each node is either red or black.

2.  The root is black. This rule is sometimes omitted. Since the root
    can always be changed from red to black, but not necessarily vice
    versa, this rule has little effect on analysis.

3.  All leaves (NIL) are black.

4.  If a node is red, then both its children are black.

5.  Every path from a given node to any of its descendant NIL nodes goes
    through the same number of black nodes.

### B-tree

A B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted
data and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions
in logarithmic time (${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(\log n)$). The B-tree
generalizes the binary search tree, allowing for nodes with more than
two children and multiple keys. It is commonly used in databases and
file systems.

The idea behind a B-tree is to collapse several levels of a binary
search tree into a single large node, so that we can make the equivalent
of several search steps before another disk access is needed. With
B-trees we can access enormous numbers of keys using only a few disk
accesses. To get the full benefit from using a B-tree, it is important
to understand how the secondary storage device and virtual memory
interact, through constants such as page size and virtual/real address
space. Cache-oblivious algorithms can mitigate such concerns.

A B-tree of order $m$ is a tree which satisfies the following
properties:

1.  The root has at least two children if it is not a leaf node.

2.  Every non-leaf node (except the root) has at least
    $ \lceil \frac{m}{2} \rceil$ child nodes.

3.  All leaves appear in the same level and carry no information.

4.  Every node has at most $m$ children.

5.  A non-leaf node with $k$ children contains $k-1$ keys.

B-trees are constructed in a bottom-up way: values are inserted into a
node based on binary search. If the node reaches its capacity based on
the degree of the B-tree, then it is split in half with left or bias and
an appropriate root (median value) and children are selected and
appointed to existing or new nodes.

For implementing multi-level indexing in a database, every node will
have a key to be indexed by, a pointer to its child nodes in their
memory blocks as well as a pointer to a record on the database (value).

In a **B+ tree**, only leaf nodes contain a record pointer with leaf
nodes also containing a copy of corresponding parent keys.

Graphs
------

A graph is simply a collection of nodes, some of which may have edges
between them. With this definition, we see that a tree is a connected
graph that does not have cycles. Graphs can be either **directed** or
**undirected**. A graph might consist of multiple isolated subgraphs. If
there is a path between every pair of vertices, it is called a
**connected** graph. A graph can also have cycles (or not), an
**acyclic** graph is one without cycles.

There are two common ways to represent a graph: **adjacency lists** and
**adjacency matrices**. Every vertex (or node) stores a list of adjacent
vertices. In an undirected graph, an edge like (a, b) would be stored
twice: once in a’s adjacent vertices and once in b’s adjacent vertices.
An adjacency matrix is an NxN boolean matrix (where N is the number of
nodes), where a true value at matrix \[i\] \[j\] indicates an edge from
node i to node j. (You can also use an integer matrix with Os and 1 s.)
In an undirected graph, an adjacency matrix will be symmetric. In a
directed graph, it will not (necessarily) be.

1.  How big will your graph be? – Adjacency matrices make sense only for
    small or very dense graphs.

2.  How dense will your graph be? –– If your graph is very dense,
    meaning that a large fraction of the vertex pairs define edges,
    there is probably no compelling reason to use adjacency lists. You
    will be doomed to using $\Theta(n^2)$ space anyway. Indeed, for
    complete graphs, matrices will be more concise due to the
    elimination of pointers.

3.  Which algorithms will you be implementing? – Certain algorithms are
    more natural on adjacency matrices (such as all-pairs shortest path)
    and others favor adjacency lists (such as most
    DFS-based algorithms). Adjacency matrices win for algorithms that
    repeatedly ask, “Is (i,j) in G?" However, most graph algorithms can
    be designed to eliminate such queries.

Will you be modifying the graph over the course of your application? –
Efficient static graph implementations can be used when no edge
insertion/deletion operations will done following initial construction.
Indeed, more common than modifying the topology of the graph is
modifying the attributes of a vertex or edge of the graph, such as size,
weight, label, or color. Attributes are best handled as extra fields in
the vertex or edge records of adjacency lists.

**Planar graphs** are those that can be drawn in the plane so no two
edges cross. Planar graphs are always sparse, since any n-vertex planar
graph can have at most $3n - 6$ edges, thus they should be represented
using adjacency lists.

**Hypergraphs** are generalized graphs where each edge may link subsets
of more than two vertices. In contrast, in an ordinary graph, an edge
connects exactly two vertices. Two basic data structures for hypergraphs
are: Incidence matrices, which are analogous to adjacency matrices, and
Bipartite incidence structures, which are analogous to adjacency lists

```

Hash Tables
-----------

A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values for highly
efficient lookup. There are a number of ways of implementing this.
First, we will describe a simple but common implementation known as
**separate chaining**. In this implementation, we use an array of linked
lists and a hash code function. To insert a key (which might be a string
or essentially any other data type) and value, we do the following:

1.  First, compute the key’s hash code, which will usually be an *int*
    or *long*. Note that two different keys could have the same hash
    code, as there may be an infinite number of keys and a finite number
    of ints.

2.  Then, map the hash code to an index in the array. This could be done
    with something like $hash(key)\mod array\_length$. Two different
    hash codes could map to the same index.

3.  At this index, there is a linked list of keys and values. Store the
    key and value in this index. We must use a linked list because of
    collisions: you could have two different keys with the same hash
    code, or two different hash codes that map to the same index.

To retrieve the value pair by its key, you repeat this process. Compute
the hash code from the key, and then compute the index from the hash
code. Then, search through the linked list for the value with this key.
If the number of collisions is very high, the worst case runtime is
${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n)$, where $n$ is the number of keys.
However, we generally assume a good implementation that keeps collisions
to a minimum, in which case the lookup time is
${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(1)$. Alternatively, we can implement the
hash table with a balanced binary search tree. This gives us an
${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(\log n)$ lookup time. The advantage of this
is potentially using less space, since we no longer allocate a large
array. We can also iterate through the keys in order, which can be
useful sometimes.

The other strategy used to resolve collisions is to require each array
element to contain only one key, but to allow keys to be mapped to
alternate indices when their original spot is already occupied. This is
known as **open addressing**. In this type of hashing, we have a
parameterized hash function $h$ that takes two arguments, a key and a
positive integer. Searching for an item requires examining not just one
spot, but many spots until either we find the key, or reach a None
value. After we delete an item, we replace it with a special value
Deleted, rather than simply None. This way, the Search algorithm will
not halt when it reaches an index that belonged to a deleted key.

The simplest implementation of open addressing is **linear probing**:
start at a given hash value and then keep adding some fixed offset to
the index until an empty spot is found. The main problem with linear
probing is that the hash values in the middle of a cluster will follow
the exact same search pattern as a hash value at the beginning of the
cluster. As such, more and more keys are absorbed into this long search
pattern as clusters grow. We can solve this problem using **quadratic
probing**, which causes the offset between consecutive indices in the
probe sequence to increase as the probe sequence is visited. **Double
hashing** resolves the problem of a form of clustering occurs where if
many items have the same initial hash value, they still follow the exact
same probe sequence. It does this by using a hash function for both the
initial value and its offset.

A useful hash function for strings is,
$$H(S,j) = \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} \alpha^{m-(i+1)} \cdot char(s_{i+j}) \mod m$$
where $\alpha$ is the size of the alphabet and $char(x)$ is the ASCII
character code. This hash function has the useful property allowing
hashes of successive m-character windows of a string to be computed in
constant time instead of ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(m)$.
$$H(S, j+1) = (H(S,j) - \alpha^{m-1}char(s_j))\alpha + s_{j+m}$$

### Dictionaries

The dictionary data type permits access to data items based on its
content. You insert an item into a dictionary so you can retrieve it
when you need it. The primary operations a dictionary supports are:

-   **search(D, k)** – Given a search key $k$, return a pointer to the
    element in dictionary $D$ whose key value is $k$, if one exists.

-   **insert(D, x)** – Given a data item $x$, add it to the set in the
    dictionary $D$.

-   **delete(D, x)** – Given a pointer to a given data item $x$ in the
    dictionary $D$, remove it from $D$.

-   **max(D)** or **min(D)** – Retrieve the item with the largest
    (or smallest) key from $D$. This enables the dictionary to serve as
    a priority queue.

-   **predecessor(D, k)** or **successor(D, k)** – Retrieve the item
    from $D$ whose key is immediately before (or after) $k$ in
    sorted order. These enable us to iterate through the elements of the
    data structure.

### Sets

In mathematical terms, a set is an unordered collection of unique
objects drawn from a fixed universal set. Sorted order turns the problem
of finding the union or intersection of two subsets into a linear-time
operation, just sweep from left to right and see what you are missing.
It makes possible element searching in sublinear time. Finally, printing
the elements of a set in a canonical order paradoxically reminds us that
order really doesn’t matter.

If each subset contains exactly two elements, they can be thought of as
edges in a graph whose vertices represent the universal set. A system of
subsets with no restrictions on the cardinality of its members is called
a hypergraph.

1.  test whether $u_i \in S_j$

2.  compute the union or intersection of $S_i$ and $S_j$

3.  insert or delete members of $S$

Although sets are commonly implemented with hashtables, other data
structures that can be used:

1.  Containers or dictionaries – A subset can also be represented using
    a linked list, array, or dictionary containing exactly the elements
    in the subset.

2.  Bit vectors – An n-bit vector or array can represent any subset $S$
    on a universal set $U$ containing $n$ items. Bit $i$ will be 1 if
    $i \in S$, and $0$ if not.

3.  Bloom filters – We can emulate a bit vector in the absence of a
    fixed universal set by hashing each subset element to an integer
    from $0$ to $n$ and setting the corresponding bit.

Algorithms and Techniques
=========================

String and Array Sorting
------------------------

### Binary Search

Time Complexity: ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(\log n)$ average and worst
case. Space Complexity: ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(1)$

In binary search, we look for an element $x$ in a sorted array by first
comparing $x$ to the midpoint of the array. If $x$ is less than the
midpoint, then we search the left half of the array. If $x$ is greater
than the midpoint, then we search the right half of the array. We then
repeat this process, treating the left and right halves as subarrays.
Again, we compare $x$ to the midpoint of this subarray and then search
either its left or right side. We repeat this process until we either
find $x$ or the subarray has size 0.

*Python Implementation*

``` {.python language="Python"}
def binary_search(nums, target):
    if len(nums) == 0:
        return -1

    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif nums[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```

### Bubble Sort

Time Complexity: ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n^2)$ average and worst
case. Space Complexity: ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(1)$

In bubble sort, we start at the beginning of the array and swap the
first two elements if the first is greater than the second. Then, we go
to the next pair, and so on, continuously making sweeps of the array
until it is sorted. In doing so, the smaller items slowly “bubble” up to
the beginning of the list.

*Python Implementation*

``` {.python language="Python"}
def bubble_sort(A):
    for i in range(len(A) - 1, 0, -1):
        for j in range(i):
            if A[j] > A[j + 1]:
                A[j], A[j + 1] = A[j + 1], A[j]
```

### Selection Sort

Time Complexity: ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n^2)$ average and worst
case. Space Complexity: ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(1)$

Selection sort is the child’s algorithm: simple, but inefficient. Find
the smallest element using a linear scan and move it to the front
(swapping it with the front element). Then, find the second smallest and
move it, again doing a linear scan. Continue doing this until all the
elements are in place.

*Python Implementation*

``` {.python language="Python"}
def selection_sort(A):
    for i in range(len(A)):
        min_index = i
        for j in range(i + 1, len(A)):
            if A[j] < A[min_index]:
                min_index = j
        if i == min_index:
            continue
        A[i], A[min_index] = A[min_index], A[i]
```

### Insertion Sort

Time Complexity: ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n^2)$ average and worst
case. Space Complexity: ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(1)$

Given an array $A$ of size $n$, iterate $i$ from $1$ to $n$ and insert
$A[i]$ into a sorted sub array $A[0, i-1]$ until the entire array is
sorted. Sorting occurs through pairwise swaps of elements down to their
correct positions.

*Python Implementation*

``` {.python language="Python"}
def insertion_sort(A):
    for i in range(1, len(A)):
        n = A[i]
        pos = i
        while pos > 0 and A[pos-1] > n:
            A[pos] = A[pos-1]
            pos -= 1
        A[pos] = n
    return A
```

### Merge Sort

Time Complexity: ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}( n \log n )$ average and
worst case. Space Complexity: Varies on implementation.

Merge sort divides the array in half, sorts each of those halves, and
then merges them back together. Each of those halves has the same
sorting algorithm applied to it. Eventually, you are merging just two
single element arrays. It is the “merge" part that does all the heavy
lifting.

The merge method operates by copying all the elements from the target
array segment into a helper array, keeping track of where the start of
the left and right halves should be. We then iterate through the helper,
copying the smaller element from each half into the array. At the end,
we copy any remaining elements into the target array. $$\begin{aligned}
        T(n) &= 
            \underbrace{c_1}_\text{divide}
            + \underbrace{2T(n/2)}_\text{recursion}
            + \underbrace{c  n}_\text{merge}\\
        &= (1 + \log n) \cdot cn\\
        &= {\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n \log n)
    \end{aligned}$$

### QuickSort

Time Complexity: ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n \log n)$ average,
${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n^2)$ worst case. Space Complexity:
${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(\log n )$

In quick sort, we pick an element and partition the array, such that all
numbers that are less than the partitioning element come before all
elements that are greater than it. The partitioning can be performed
efficiently through a series of swaps.

If we repeatedly partition the array (and its sub-arrays) around an
element, the array will eventually become sorted. However, as the
partitioned element is not guaranteed to be the median (or anywhere near
the median), our sorting could be very slow. This is the reason for the
0 ($n^2$) worst case runtime.

If we allow our algorithm to make random choices, we can turn any input
into a “random” input simply by preprocessing it, and then applying the
regular quicksort function. To run **randomized quicksort** on an array
$A$ with length $n$, we can define the random variable $T_A$ to be the
running time of the algorithm. Now we are considering the probability
distribution which the algorithm uses to make its random choices, and
not a probability distribution over inputs,
$E[T_A] = \Theta(n \log{n})$.

*Python Implementation*

``` {.python language="Python"}
import random

def partition(arr, start, end, pivot_mode):
    if pivot_mode == 'first':
        pivot = arr[start]
    else:
        pivot_index = random.randrange(start, end)
        pivot = arr[pivot_index]
        arr[pivot_index], arr[start] = arr[start], arr[pivot_index] # place the pivot at the start
    i = start + 1
    for j in range(start + 1, end + 1):
        if arr[j] < pivot:
            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
            i += 1
    arr[start], arr[i-1] = arr[i-1], arr[start]
    return i-1

def quicksort(arr, start, end, pivot_mode='random'):
    if start < end:
        split = partition(arr, start, end, pivot_mode)
        quicksort(arr, start, split-1, pivot_mode)
        quicksort(arr, split+1, end, pivot_mode)
    return arr
```

### Heap Sort

Time Complexity: ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n^2)$ average and worst
case. Space Complexity: ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n)$

Given a heap, we can extract a sorted list of the elements in the heap
simply by repeatedly calling Remove and adding the items to a list. In
particular, the Heap Sort algorithm does the following:

1.  Build a max heap from an unordered array A in
    ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n)$.

2.  Find the max element A\[1\] in ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(1)$.

3.  Swap elements A\[n\] with A\[1\] so that the max element is at the
    end of the array in in ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(1)$.

4.  Extract node $n$ from the array and decrement the heap size in
    ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(1)$.

5.  The new node may violate the max heap principle but the
    children won’t. This allows us to run heapify in
    ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(\log n)$.

*Python Implementation*

``` {.python language="Python"}
import heapq

def heapsort(A):
    h = []
    for value in A:
        heapq.heappush(h, value)
    return [heapq.heappop(h) for i in range(len(h))]
```

### Counting Sort

Time Complexity: ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n + k)$ average and worst
case, Space Complexity: ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n + k)$ (where $k$
is the range of the non-negative key values.)

Instead of using comparison operations as in previous sorting
algorithms, counting sort uses integer sorting and relies on a sorting
technique based on keys between a specific range. It works by counting
the number of objects having distinct key values (a kind of hashing),
then doing some arithmetic to calculate the position of each object in
the output sequence.

Its running time is linear in the number of items and the difference
between the maximum and minimum key values, so it is only suitable for
direct use in situations where the variation in keys is not
significantly greater than the number of items. However, it is often
used as a subroutine in another sorting algorithm, radix sort, that can
handle larger keys more efficiently.

*Python Implementation*

``` {.python language="Python"}
def count_sort(arr):
    output = [0 for i in range(256)]
    count = [0 for i in range(256)]
    ans = ["" for _ in arr]

    for i in arr:
        count[ord(i)] += 1

    # Change count[i] so that count[i] now contains actual
    # position of this character in output array
    for i in range(256):
        count[i] += count[i-1]

    # Build the output character array
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        output[count[ord(arr[i])]-1] = arr[i]
        count[ord(arr[i])] -= 1

    # Copy the output array to arr, so that arr now
    # contains sorted characters
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        ans[i] = output[i]
    return ans
```

### Radix Sort

Time Complexity: ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(w \cdot n)$ average and
worst case, Space Complexity: ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(w + n)$ (where
$w$ is the number of bits required to store each key)

Radix is a Latin word for “root" which can be considered a synonym for
an arithmetical base, where decimal is base 10. For simplicity, say you
want to use the decimal radix (= 10) for sorting. Then you would start
by separating the numbers by units and then putting them together again;
next you would separate the numbers by tens and then put them together
again; then by hundreds and so on until all the numbers are sorted. Each
time you loop, just read the list from left to right. You can also
imagine you are separating the numbers into buckets.

Radix sort can be applied to data that can be sorted lexicographically,
i.e integers, words, playing cards, etc. Unlike radix sort, quicksort is
universal, while radix sort is only useful for fixed length integer
keys. It’s also of note that ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(f(n))$ really
means in order of $K*f(n)$, where $K$ is some arbitrary constant. For
radix sort this $K$ happens to be quite large (at least on the order of
number of bits in the integers sorted), on the other hand quicksort has
one of the lowest $K$ among all sorting algorithms and average
complexity of $n \cdot \log(n)$. Thus in real life scenario quicksort
will often be faster than radix sort.

*Python Implementation*

``` {.python language="Python"}
def radix_sort(A):
    RADIX = 10
    maxLength = False
    tmp, placement = -1, 1

    while not maxLength:
        maxLength = True
        # declare and initialize buckets
        buckets = [list() for _ in range(RADIX)]

        # split A between lists
        for i in A:
            tmp = i / placement
            buckets[tmp % RADIX].append(i)
            if maxLength and tmp > 0:
                maxLength = False

        # empty lists into A array
        a = 0
        for b in range(RADIX):
            buck = buckets[b]
            for i in buck:
                A[a] = i
                a += 1

        # move to next digit
        placement *= RADIX
```

### Timsort

Time Complexity: ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n)$ Best-case,
${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n\log n)$ average and worst case, Memory
${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n)$.

Timsort is a hybrid stable sorting algorithm, derived from merge sort
and insertion sort, designed to perform well on many kinds of real-world
data. The algorithm finds subsequences of the data that are already
ordered (runs) and uses them to sort the remainder more efficiently.
This is done by merging runs until certain criteria are fulfilled.
Timsort has been Python’s standard sorting algorithm since version 2.3.

Array Analysis Methods
----------------------

### Two Pointer Technique

Time complexity: ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n^2)$, Space Complexity:
${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(1)$

The two pointer technique uses two references to values in a given array
to check if they satisfy a condition otherwise the pointers (usually)
move towards the middle of the array being iterated over.

*Python Implementation*

``` {.python language="Python"}
def left_right_boundary(self, seq):
    left, right = 0, len(seq) - 1
    while left < right:
        if self.left_condition(left):
            left += 1

        if self.right_condition(right):
            right -= 1

        self.validate(left, right)
```

### Fast and Slow Pointers

Time Complexity: ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n)$, Space Complexity:
${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(1)$

The fast and slow pointers/runners pattern (a.k.a. Floyd’s Tortoise and
Hare Algorithm) is very useful when dealing with cyclic linked lists or
arrays. By moving at different speeds, the algorithm proves that the two
pointers are going to meet eventually. The fast pointer should catch the
slow pointer once both the pointers are in a cyclic loop.

If the list has $n$ nodes, then in $\leq n$ steps, either the fast
pointer will find the end of the list, or there is a loop and the slow
pointer will be in the loop.

Lets say the loop is of length $m \leq n$: Once the slow pointer is in
the loop, both the fast and slow pointers will be stuck in the loop
forever. Each step, the distance between the fast and the slow pointers
will increase by 1. When the distance is divisible by $m$, then the fast
and slow pointers will be on the same node and the algorithm terminates.
The distance will reach a number divisible by $m$ in $\leq m$ steps.

So, getting the slow pointer to the loop, and then getting the fast and
slow pointers to meet takes $\leq n + m \leq 2n$ steps, and that is in
${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n)$.

*Python Implementation*

``` {.python language="Python"}
def has_cycle(self, head):
    try:
        slow, fast = head, head.next
        while slow is not fast:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        return True
    except AttributeError:
        return False
```

### Sliding Window Technique

Time Complexity: ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n)$, Space Complexity:
${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(k)$, where $k$ is the length of a pattern or
restrict sequence

1.  Use two pointers, start and end, to represent a window.

2.  Move end to find a valid window.

3.  When a valid window is found, move start to find a smaller window.

Sliding windows are commonly used to find a match or maximum/minimum in
a given subarray or substring. It uses two pointers as the boundary of a
sliding window to traverse and may also use a counter dictionary to
maintain current state.

The characteristics of problems that can be solved using the two pointer
technique:

1.  If the narrow scope of your window is valid, then the wider scope
    is valid. By definition of the narrow window being a sub problem of
    the wider problem.

2.  If the wider scope of the window is invalid, then the narrow scope
    is also invalid. By definition of the wider window being a full
    problem of the given sub problem.

3.  If the narrow scope of your window is invalid, it doesn’t always
    mean the wider scope is invalid. You need to increment the pointers
    to find out (this is why the 2 pointer solution works, after all).
    In a given narrow window, you cannot guarantee that this window
    means the solution cannot be found, because the narrow window is
    just a slice of a given string or subarray. Then, if all
    sub-problems are solved and the wider problem is also invalid, then
    we can say that all sub problems or sub strings cannot be formed to
    solve the problem.

*Python Implementation*

``` {.python language="Python"}
def basic_sliding_window(self, seq):
    start, end = 0, 0
    while end < len(seq):
        # end grows in the outer loop
        end += 1
        # start grows with some restrict
        while self.start_condition(start):
            # process logic before pointers movement
            self.process_logic1(start, end)
            # start grows in the inner loop
            start += 1
        # or process logic after pointers movement
        self.process_logic2(start, end)

# Using a counter
from collections import Counter

# s - target sequence, p - pattern or restrict sequence
def sliding_window_with_counter(s, p):
    counter = Counter(p)
    start, end, count, res = 0, 0, 0, 0
    while end < len(s):
        counter[s[end]] += 1
        if counter[s[end]] > 1:
            count += 1
        end += 1
        while count > 0:
            # update res here if finding minimum
            # increase start to make it invalid or valid again
            counter[s[start]] -= 1
            # update count based on some condition
            if counter[s[start]] > 0:
                count -= 1
            start += 1
        # update res here if finding maximum
        res = max(res, end - start)
    return res
```

### Single-pass with Lookup Table

Time Complexity: ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n)$, Space Complexity:
${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n)$

This technique is useful when searching an array for a pair of values,
though the method can be extrapolated to triples and more. Given an
array and a target we first initialize a lookup table, usually as a hash
table or dictionary. Next, we iterate over the array checking if the
complement to the current value needed to satisfy the target exists in
our lookup table. If it exists, meaning we’ve visited the complement
before, we retrieve the value from the pointer in the lookup and return
it with the current index. Otherwise we add the current value to the
lookup table with its index.

*Python Implementation*

``` {.python language="Python"}
def single_pass_lookup(nums], target):
    lookup = {}
    for i, v in enumerate(nums):
        if target - v in lookup:
            return i, lookup[target - v]
        lookup[v] = i
    raise ValueError('Target not in list.')
```

### Range Operations on Array

Time Complexity: ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(Q + n)$, Space Complexity:
${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(1)$, where $Q$ is the number of
operations/queries

Given an array $A$ of 0’s of size $n$, perform $Q$ operations or queries
by incrementing values in the subarray $A[L: R]$ by 1. A naive brute
force solution of performing all the given operations will result in
time complexity of ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(Q\cdot n)$.

However, using a numerical method we are able to reduce the time
complexity to ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(Q + n)$. This technique
involves creating a secondary array $B$ and only incrementing the value
at the left endpoint, $L$ by 1 and decrementing the value at index
$R + 1$ by 1. After repeating this process for all queries, to find the
true desired value of $A[i]$ we can find the prefix sum of $B$ from
$B[0:i]$.

If instead we want to find the maximum in the array after performing $Q$
range operations, we can modify the above techinque which will give us
an algorithm that runs in ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n)$. It does this
by storing the difference between the current element and the previous
element. This means that we add the sum to $A[i]$ showing that $A[i]$ is
greater than its previous element by the sum. We subtract sum from
$A[j+1]$ to show that $A[j+1]$ is less than $A[j]$ by sum (since $A[j]$
was the last element that was added to sum). By the end of all this, we
have an array that shows the difference between every successive
element. By adding all the positive differences, we get the value of the
maximum element

*Python Implementation*

``` {.python language="Python"}
def arrayOperations(n, operations):
    B = [0] * (n + 1)
    for start, end, incr in operations:
        B[start - 1] += incr
        if stop <= len(B):
            B[stop] -= incr;
    max = cur = 0
    for i in B:
        cur = cur + i;
        if max < cur: 
            max = cur;
    return max
```

### Kadane’s Algorithm

Time Complexity: ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n)$, Space Complexity:
${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(1)$

The maximum sum subarray problem is the task of finding a contiguous
subarray with the largest sum, within a given one-dimensional array
$A[1...n]$ of numbers.

This problem can be solved using several different algorithmic
techniques, including brute force, divide and conquer, dynamic
programming, and reduction to shortest paths. Kadane’s algorithm can be
viewed as a trivial example of dynamic programming which will be visited
in more detail later.

1.  Use the input vector nums to store the candidate subarrays sum (i.e.
    the greatest contiguous sum so far).

2.  Ignore cumulative negatives, as they don’t contribute positively to
    the sum.

*Python Implementation*

``` {.python language="Python"}
def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i-1] > 0:
            nums[i] += nums[i-1]
    return max(nums)
```

String Analysis Methods
-----------------------

A string is a sequence of ASCII characters. Many analysis techniques
that apply to arrays can also be used on string inputs when they are
interpreted as character arrays.

### KMP Pattern Matching

Time Complexity: ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n)$ Space Complexity:
${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(k)$, where $n$ is the length of the string
and $k$ is the length of the pattern

KMP (Knuth Morris Pratt) pattern matching improves the worst case
complexity of a naive approach to ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n)$. The
basic idea behind KMP’s algorithm is that whenever we detect a mismatch
after some matches, we know some of the characters in the text of the
next window. Instead of wasting computation on previous matches, we use
a precomputed lookup table to skip to the first instance of a match of
the starting character.

*Python Implementation*

``` {.python language="Python"}
class KMP:
    def partial(self, pattern):
        """ Calculate partial match table: String -> [Int]"""
        ret = [0]
        for i in range(1, len(pattern)):
            j = ret[i - 1]
            while j > 0 and pattern[j] != pattern[i]:
                j = ret[j - 1]
            ret.append(j + 1 if pattern[j] == pattern[i] else j)
        return ret
        
    def search(self, T, P):
        """ 
        KMP search main algorithm: String -> String -> [Int] 
        Return all the matching position of pattern string P in T
        """
        partial, ret, j = self.partial(P), [], 0
        
        for i in range(len(T)):
            while j > 0 and T[i] != P[j]:
                j = partial[j - 1]
            if T[i] == P[j]: j += 1
            if j == len(P): 
                ret.append(i - (j - 1))
                j = partial[j - 1]
            
        return ret
```

### Rabin–Karp

The Rabin–Karp algorithm is a string-searching algorithm that uses
hashing to find an exact match of a pattern string in a text. It uses a
rolling hash to quickly filter out positions of the text that cannot
match the pattern, and then checks for a match at the remaining
positions.

### Merge Intervals

Time Complexity: ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n \log n)$, Space
Complexity: ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(n)$

An interval problem has an input of a 2d array in which each nested
array represents a start and an end value. The interval can also be
represented as an object with start and end attributes.

Given two intervals A and B, there will be six different ways the two
intervals can relate to each other:

1.  A and B do not overlap, A before B

2.  A and B overlap, B ends after A

3.  A completely overlaps B

4.  A and B overlap, A ends after B

5.  A and B do not overlap, B before A

If a.start $\leq$ b.start, only 1, 2 and 3 are possible from the above
scenarios. Our goal is to merge the intervals whenever they overlap.

*Python Implementation*

``` {.python language="Python"}
def merge_intervals(self, intervals):
    if len(intervals) < 2: return intervals

    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    merged = []
    start = intervals[0][0]
    end = intervals[0][1]

    for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
        interval = intervals[i]
        if interval[0] <= end:  # overlapping intervals
            end = max(interval[1], end)
        else:  # non-overlapping interval, add the previous interval and reset
            merged.append([start, end])
            start = interval[0]
            end = interval[1]

    merged.append([start, end])  # add the last interval
    return merged
```

Tree Traversal
--------------

Given a binary tree, an **in-order traversal** (LNR) means to visit the
left branch, then the current node, and finally, the right branch. A
**pre-order traversal** (NLR) visits the current node before its child
nodes, i.e. the root is always the first node visited. A **post-order
traversal** (LRN) visits the current node after its child nodes, i.e.
the root node is always the last node visited.

*Python Implementation*

``` {.python language="Python"}
def inorder(root): 
    if root: 
        inorder(root.left) 
        print(root.val)
        inorder(root.right) 
  
def postorder(root): 
    if root: 
        postorder(root.left) 
        postorder(root.right) 
        print(root.val)
        
def preorder(root): 
    if root: 
        print(root.val)
        preorder(root.left) 
        preorder(root.right) 
```

Heap Use Cases
--------------

### Top K Numbers

The best data structure to keep track of top $K$ elements is a heap. If
we iterate through an array, one element at a time, and keep $K$-th
largest element in a heap such that each time we find a larger number
than the smallest number in the heap, we do two things:

1.  Take out the smallest number from the heap

2.  Insert the larger number into the heap

This will ensure that we always have top $K$ largest numbers in the
heap. We may use a min-heap for this.

*Python Implementation*

``` {.python language="Python"}
import heapq

# For maintaining a class
class KthLargestHeap:
    def __init__(self, k: int, nums):
        self.pq, self.k = [], k
        for n in nums:
            self.add(n)

    def add(self, val: int) -> int:
        heapq.heappush(self.pq, val)
        if len(self.pq) > self.k:
            heapq.heappop(self.pq)
        return self.pq[0]

# For one time calculation
def findKthLargest(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        min_heap = []
        for i in range(k):
            heapq.heappush(min_heap, nums[i])
        for i in range(k, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > min_heap[0]:
                heapq.heappop(min_heap)
                heapq.heappush(min_heap, nums[i])
        return min_heap[0]
```

### Two Heaps (Median of Data Stream)

If we maintain two heaps, we can keep track of the bigger half and the
smaller half of a stream of data. The bigger half is kept in a min heap,
such that the smallest element in the bigger half is at the root. The
smaller half is kept in a max heap, such that the biggest element of the
smaller half is at the root. Now, with these data structures, we have
the potential median elements at the roots. If the heaps are no longer
the same size, we can easily re-balance the heaps by popping an element
off the one heap and pushing it onto the other.

*Python Implementation*

``` {.python language="Python"}
from heapq import *

class MedianFinder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.heaps = [], []

    def addNum(self, num):
        small, large = self.heaps
        #convert a min heap to a max heap. heapq only has a min heap by default.
        heappush(small, -heappushpop(large, num))
        if len(large) < len(small):
            heappush(large, -heappop(small))

    def findMedian(self):
        small, large = self.heaps
        if len(large) > len(small):
            return float(large[0])
        return (large[0] - small[0]) / 2.0
```

Graph Traversal
---------------

### Breadth-First Search

Time Complexity: ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(|V| + |E|)$ worst case,
Space Complexity: ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(|V|)$

In a breadth-first search (BFS), we start at the root (or another
arbitrarily selected node) and explore each neighbor before going on to
any of their children. That is, we go wide before we go deep.

In BFS, node x visits each of x’s neighbors before visiting any of their
neighbors. You can think of this as searching level by level out from x.
An iterative solution involving a **queue** usually works best.

*Python Implementation*

``` {.python language="Python"}
from collections import deque

def bfs(matrix):
    # Check for an empty graph.
    if not matrix:
        return []

    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    visited = set()
    directions = ((0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0))

    def traverse(i, j):
        queue = deque([(i, j)])
        while queue:
            curr_i, curr_j = queue.popleft()
            if (curr_i, curr_j) not in visited:
                visited.add((curr_i, curr_j))
                # Traverse neighbors.
                for direction in directions:
                    next_i, next_j = curr_i + \
                        direction[0], curr_j + direction[1]
                    if 0 <= next_i < rows and 0 <= next_j < cols:
                        # Add in your question-specific checks.
                        queue.append((next_i, next_j))

    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            traverse(i, j)
```

### Depth-First Search 

Time Complexity: ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(|V| + |E|)$ worst case,
Space Complexity: ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(|V|)$

In depth-first search (DFS), we start at the root (or another
arbitrarily selected node) and explore each branch completely before
moving on to the next branch. That is, we go deep first before we go
wide.

Note that pre-order and other forms of tree traversal are a form of DFS.
The key difference is that when implementing this algorithm for a graph,
we must check if the node has been visited. If we don’t, we risk getting
stuck in an infinite loop.

*Python Implementation*

``` {.python language="Python"}
def dfs(matrix):
    # Check for an empty graph.
    if not matrix:
        return []

    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    visited = set()
    directions = ((0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0))

    def traverse(i, j):
        if (i, j) in visited:
            return

        visited.add((i, j))
        # Traverse neighbors.
        for direction in directions:
            next_i, next_j = i + direction[0], j + direction[1]
            if 0 <= next_i < rows and 0 <= next_j < cols:
                # Add in your question-specific checks.
                traverse(next_i, next_j)

    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            traverse(i, j)
```

### Bidirectional Search

Bidirectional search is used to find the shortest path between a source
and destination node. It operates by essentially running two
simultaneous breadth-first searches, one from each node. When their
searches collide, we have found a path. If every node has at most $k$
adjacent nodes and the shortest path from node $s$ to node $t$ has
length. Then, in a traditional breadth-first search we visit
$\mathcal{O}(k^d)$ nodes while bidrectional search visits
$\mathcal{O}(k^{d/2})$

### Dijkstra’s algorithm

Time Complexity: $\Theta (|E|+|V|\log |V|)$ worst case

An algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph.
For a given source node in the graph, the algorithm finds the shortest
path between that node and every other. Let the node at which we are
starting be called the initial node and the distance of node Y be the
distance from the initial node to Y. Dijkstra’s algorithm will assign
some initial distance values and will try to improve them step by step.

Djikstra’s algorithm prioritizes shorter distances and edges with low
weights in its path discovery process.

1.  Mark all nodes unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited nodes
    called the unvisited set.

2.  Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for
    our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes. Set the
    initial node as current.

3.  For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbours and
    calculate their tentative distances through the current node.
    Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current
    assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the
    current node A is marked with a distance of 6, and the edge
    connecting it with a neighbour B has length 2, then the distance to
    B through A will be 6 + 2 = 8. If B was previously marked with a
    distance greater than 8 then change it to 8. Otherwise, the current
    value will be kept.

4.  When we are done considering all of the unvisited neighbours of the
    current node, mark the current node as visited and remove it from
    the unvisited set. A visited node will never be checked again.

5.  If the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a
    route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative
    distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when
    planning a complete traversal; occurs when there is no connection
    between the initial node and remaining unvisited nodes), then stop.
    The algorithm has finished.

6.  Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the
    smallest tentative distance, set it as the new “current node", and
    go back to step 3.

The code for maintaining the visited set can be simplified by using a
priority queue.

*Python Implementation*

``` {.python language="Python"}
from collections import defaultdict
from heapq import *

def dijkstra(edges, f, t):
    g = defaultdict(list)
    for l,r,c in edges:
        g[l].append((c,r))

    q, seen, mins = [(0,f,())], set(), {f: 0}
    while q:
        (cost,v1,path) = heappop(q)
        if v1 not in seen:
            seen.add(v1)
            path = (v1, path)
            if v1 == t: return (cost, path)

            for c, v2 in g.get(v1, ()):
                if v2 in seen: continue
                prev = mins.get(v2, None)
                next = cost + c
                if prev is None or next < prev:
                    mins[v2] = next
                    heappush(q, (next, v2, path))

    return float("inf")
```

### A\*

A\* (pronounced “A-star") is a graph traversal and path search
algorithm. It is a minor extension of Djikstra’s algorithm that builds
in a heuristic for remaining distance used to indicate the relevance of
paths which should be tried first.

One important aspect of A\* is $F = G + H$. The $F$, $G$, and $H$
variables are in our Node class and get calculated every time we create
a new node.

-   $F$ is the total cost of the node.

-   $G$ is the distance between the current node and the start node.

-   $H$ is the heuristic — estimated distance from the current node to
    the end node.

A major practical drawback is its ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(b^d)$
space complexity, as it stores all generated nodes in memory.

Graph Analysis Methods
----------------------

### Topological Sort

Time Complexity: ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(|V| + |E|)$ worst case,
Space Complexity: ${\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}(|V|)$

A topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a
linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge $uv$
from vertex $u$ to vertex $v$, $u$ comes before $v$ in the ordering. A
topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no
directed cycles, that is, if it is a **directed acyclic graph** (DAG).
Any DAG has at least one topological ordering, and algorithms are known
for constructing a topological ordering of any DAG in linear time.

An algorithm for topological sorting is based on depth-first search.
Simply put, run DFS and output the reverse of the finishing times of
vertices, where finishing time corresponds to number of steps taken by
DFS. The algorithm loops through each node of the graph, in an arbitrary
order, initiating a depth-first search that terminates when it hits any
node that has already been visited since the beginning of the
topological sort or the node has no outgoing edges (i.e. a leaf node).
Each node $n$ gets prepended to the output list $L$ only after
considering all other nodes which depend on $n$ (all descendants of $n$
in the graph). Specifically, when the algorithm adds node $n$, we are
guaranteed that all nodes which depend on $n$ are already in the output
list $L$: they were added to $L$ either by the recursive call to visit()
which ended before the call to visit $n$, or by a call to visit() which
started even before the call to visit $n$. Since each edge and node is
visited once, the algorithm runs in linear time.

*Python Implementation*

``` {.python language="Python"}
from collections import deque
GRAY, BLACK = 0, 1

def topological_sort(graph):
    order, enter, state = deque(), set(graph), {}

    def dfs(node):
        state[node] = GRAY
        for k in graph.get(node, ()):
            sk = state.get(k, None)
            if sk == GRAY:
                raise ValueError("cycle")
            if sk == BLACK:
                continue
            enter.discard(k)
            dfs(k)
        order.appendleft(node)
        state[node] = BLACK

    while enter:
        dfs(enter.pop())
    return order
```

Recursive Problems
------------------

Although there is some overlap, recursive solutions can be thought of in
terms of the following categories,

-   Iteration – instead of iterating with a for loop, a recursive call
    stack is used to iterate over an array/list. This often simplifies
    the code.

-   Sub-problems – A catch-all for generic and classic recursion
    problems in which a solution to the larger problem can be derived
    from solutions of the sub-problems.

-   Selection – Problems that can be solved by finding all valid
    combinations of a set of inputs. A brute-force approach that finds
    all possible combinations and then validates based on the
    requirements of problem statement. Can be further optimized to
    continuously validate at every decision step, dropping invalid
    branches of combinations using backtracking or caching relevant
    computations using dynamic programming.

-   Ordering (Permutations) – Similar to selection but the ordering of
    the selections matters.

-   Divide and Conquer – Similar to sub-problems, but instead of solving
    for n sub-problems, we split the input into two halves and
    recursively validate the sub-problem dropping one half at
    each recursion. Commonly found in searching and sorting problems.

-   Depth-first search – A common technique used in tree/graph
    structures, where a recursive call is used instead of using
    stack ADT.

A **bottom-up** approach is often the most intuitive recursive pattern.
We start with knowing how to solve the problem for a simple case, like a
list with only one element. Then we figure out how to solve the problem
for two elements, then for three elements, and so on. The key here is to
think about how you can build the solution for one case off of the
previous case (or multiple previous cases).

The **top-down** approach can be more complex since it’s less concrete.
But sometimes, it’s the best way to think about the problem. In these
problems, we think about how we can divide the problem for case $N$ into
subproblems. Be careful of overlap between the cases.

**Half-and-Half** Approach. In addition to top-down and bottom-up
approaches, it’s often effective to divide the data set in half. For
example, binary search works with a “half-and-half” approach. When we
look for an element in a sorted array, we first figure out which half of
the array contains the value. Then we recurse and search for it in that
half.

All recursive algorithms can be implemented iteratively, although
sometimes the code to do so is much more complex. Drawing the recursive
calls as a tree is a useful way to figure out the runtime of a recursive
algorithm.

### Greedy Algorithms

A greedy algorithm, as the name suggests, always makes the choice that
seems to be the best at that moment. This means that it makes a
locally-optimal choice in the hope that this choice will lead to a
globally-optimal solution. They never look backwards at what they’ve
done to see if they could optimise globally. This is the main difference
between Greedy and Dynamic Programming.

Even though a greedy algorithm follows the problem-solving heuristic of
making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the intent of
finding a global optimum, there are cases where locally optimal
solutions or maxima are not the global optimal solution which will cause
the algorithm to product incorrect solutions. Nonetheless a greedy
heuristic may yield locally optimal solutions that approximate a
globally optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time.

Greedy algorithms are only ideal for problems which have optimal
substructure. A problem is said to have **optimal substructure** if an
optimal solution can be constructed efficiently from optimal solutions
of its subproblem. Typically, a greedy algorithm is used to solve a
problem with optimal substructure if it can be proven by induction that
it is optimal at each step. Otherwise, provided the problem exhibits
overlapping subproblems, then dynamic programming is preferable. If
there are no appropriate greedy algorithms and the problem fails to
exhibit overlapping subproblems, often a lengthy but straightforward
search of the solution space is the best alternative.

### Backtracking

Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions
to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction
problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and
abandons a candidate (“backtracks") as soon as it determines that the
candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.

It is useful for exhaustive recursive problems in which the solution
must follow some constraints. We may define a policy for recursion and
when a computation does not meet the constraints, we halt or backtrack
on the exhaustive recursion.

The call stack remembers our previous choices and decides what choice to
make next.

Three key things to keep in mind

1.  Our choice – What choice do we make at each call of the function?
    Recursion expresses this decision

2.  Our constraints – When do we stop following a certain path?

3.  Our goal – What’s our target? What are we trying to find?

Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions
to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction
problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and
abandons a candidate as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot
possibly be completed to a valid solution.

The difference between backtracking and depth-first search is that
backtracking traverses in the solution space whereas DFS traverses in
data structure space, pruned of DFS.

*Python Implementation*

``` {.python language="Python"}
def backtracking(self, data, candidate):
    # pruning
    if self.reject(data, candidate):
        return

    # reach the end
    if self.accept(data, candidate):
        return self.output(data, candidate)

    # drill down
    for cur_candidate in self.all_extension(data, candidate):
        # or you can choose to prune here, recursion depth - 1
        if not self.should_to_be_pruned(cur_candidate):
            self.backtracking(data, cur_candidate)
```

### Dynamic Programming & Memoization

Dynamic programming (DP) is a general, powerful algorithm design
technique. It is mostly just a matter of taking a recursive algorithm
and finding the overlapping subproblems (that is, the repeated calls).
You then cache those results for future recursive calls. Alternatively,
you can study the pattern of the recursive calls and implement something
iterative. You still cache previous work. A dynamical programming
solution can only be used if the problem possesses the optimal
substructure property, i.e. its global optimal solution can be
constructed efficiently from optimal solutions of its subproblems.

A problem is said to have **overlapping subproblems** if the problem can
be broken down into subproblems which are reused several times or a
recursive algorithm for the problem solves the same subproblem over and
over rather than always generating new subproblems. DP corresponds to a
careful bruteforce approach, taking an exponential algorithm and making
it polynomial. The basic idea of dynamic programming is to take a
problem, split it into subproblems, solve the subproblems, and re-use
the solutions to the subproblems.

**Memoization** refers to the technique of caching and reusing
previously computed results. Some people call top-down dynamic
programming “memoization” and only use “dynamic programming” to refer to
bottom-up work

A bottom-up solution uses **tabulation** to only store the relevant
calls needed for future computations. With tabulation, we have to come
up with an ordering which is often less intuitive than memoized
solutions. If all sub-problems must be solved at least once, a bottom-up
tabulated dynamic programming algorithm usually outperforms a top-down
memoized algorithm by a constant factor.

A memoized function only recurses the first time it’s called with the
memoized call costing $\Theta(1)$. In general, the time complexity will
be the number of subproblems needed to be solved multiplied by the
running time per subproblem. We no longer need to count recursions or
the call stack.

1.  Define subproblems

2.  Guess (part of the solution)

3.  Relate subproblem solutions (with a recurrence)

4.  Construct an algorithm by recursion and memoization (need
    acyclic DAG) or building a DP table bottom up (need
    topological order)

5.  Solve original problem. Time = number of subproblems multiplied by
    running time/ subproblem

Defining subproblems for strings, sequences:

-   suffixes x\[i:\] for all i. $\mathcal{O}(n)$

-   prefixes x\[:i\] for all i. $\mathcal{O}(n)$

-   substrings x\[i:j\] for all $i \leq j$ $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$

Topological order, i.e. order in which subproblems are executed, should
be from smallest to largest.

Two kinds of guessing:

-   Which subproblems to use to solve bigger subproblem.

-   Add more subproblems to guess, remember more features of the
    solution variations.

Numerical Problems
------------------

### Bit Manipulation

Bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or
other pieces of data shorter than a word. Computer programming tasks
that require bit manipulation include low-level device control, error
detection and correction algorithms, data compression, encryption
algorithms, and optimization. For most other tasks, modern programming
languages allow the programmer to work directly with abstractions
instead of bits that represent those abstractions. Source code that does
bit manipulation makes use of the bitwise operations: AND, OR, XOR, NOT,
and bit shifts.

Bit manipulation, in some cases, can obviate or reduce the need to loop
over a data structure and can give many-fold speed ups, as bit
manipulations are processed in parallel, but the code can become more
difficult to write and maintain.

At the heart of bit manipulation are the bit-wise operators

-   & (and)

-   $\vert$ (or)

-   $\sim$ (not)

-   $\wedge$ (exclusive-or, xor)

-   a $<<$ b, a $>>$ b (shift operators)

The exclusive-or operation takes two inputs and returns a 1 if either
one or the other of the inputs is a 1, but not if both are. That is, if
both inputs are 1 or both inputs are 0, it returns 0. Bitwise
exclusive-or, with the operator of a caret, performs the exclusive-or
operation on each pair of bits. Exclusive-or is commonly abbreviated
XOR.

-   Set union: $A \vert B$

-   Set intersection: $A \And B$

-   Set subtraction: $A \And \sim B$

-   Set negation: $\text{ALL BITS } \wedge A$ or $\sim A$

-   Set bit: $A \vert= 1 <<  \text{bit}$

-   Clear bit: $A \And = \sim (1 << \text{bit})$

-   Test bit: $(A \& 1 << \text{bit}) != 0$

-   Extract last bit: $A\And-A$ or $A \And \sim (A-1)$ or
    $x\wedge (x \And (x -1))$

-   Remove last bit: $A \And (A-1)$

-   Get all 1-bits: $\sim 0$

Two’s complement is a mathematical operation on binary numbers, and is
an example of a radix complement. It is used in computing as a method of
signed number representation. The two’s complement of an N-bit number is
defined as its complement with respect to $2^N$. For instance, for the
three-bit number 010, the two’s complement is 110, because 010 + 110 =
1000. The two’s complement is calculated by inverting the digits and
adding one.

### Permuations

### n-th Partial Sum

This counting formula can be used to count the number of contiguous
substrings in a a string or contiguous subarrays in an array.
$$\sum_{k=1}^n k = 1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$

*Python Implementation*

``` {.python language="Python"}
n = 10
nth_partial_sum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2 
iterative_sum_count = sum([i for i in range(1, n + 1)])
contiguous_sublists = lambda l: [
    l[m: n + 1] 
    for m in range(len(l)) 
    for n in range(m, len(l))
]
contiguous_sublist_count = len(contiguous_sublists([0] * n ))

assert iterative_sum_count == nth_partial_sum == contiguous_sublist_count
```

### Lattice Paths

A sequence of ordered pairs $(m_1, n_1), (m_2, n_2), \cdots, (m_t, n_t)$
such that either:

1.  $m_{i+1} = m_{i}+1$ and $n_{i+1} = n_{i}$

2.  $m_{i+1} = m_i$ and $n_{i+1} = n_i +1$.

The construction of lattice paths forms a bijection with $X$-strings
where $X = \{ H, V\}$ with $H,V$ encoding horizontal or vertical moves
on a grid. The number of lattice paths from $(m_1, n_1)$ to $(m_2,n_2)$
is, $$\binom{m_2 - m_1 + m_2 - m_1}{m_2-m_1}.$$

*Python Implementation*

``` {.python language="Python"}
import math

def unique_paths(m, n):
    if not m or not n: return 0
    return math.factorial(m + n - 2)/(math.factorial(n - 1) * math.factorial(m - 1))
```

### Stars and bars

The number of ways to put $n$ identical objects into $k$ labeled boxes
is, $$\binom{n+k-1}{n}.$$

We can use this for various counting problems, i.e the number of
non-negative integer sums, the number of lower-bound integer sums, etc.

*Python Implementation*

``` {.python language="Python"}
import itertools

def stars_and_bars(n, k):
    for c in itertools.combinations(range(n+k-1), k-1):
        yield [b-a-1 for a, b in zip((-1,)+c, c+(n+k-1,))]
```
